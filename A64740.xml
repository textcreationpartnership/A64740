         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am ſenſible that this Mortification of your Triumphs, by ſo unſeaſonable an Addreſs, when your Lordſhip has hardly had time to breathe, after Victory over Rebels, to be engaged in the ſo formidable Rencounter, as that of a Dedication, may, at firſt, ſeem a Crime not to be expiated. But if it be conſider'd, that your Lordſhip has exerted your Loyalty in ſuch a manner, that your Actions bear that Face and Character, as challenge, not only
<pb facs="tcp:53621:3"/>our preſent Admiration and Eulogies, but ſtand as Glorious Examples, as well to all Poſterity, as the preſent Age, and will, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, prove the greateſt Embeliſhments of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtory, it cannot, in the leaſt, be wond'red that I ſtrike in with the publick Celebrations. Freedoms and Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this nature, are the inevitable Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of ſuch like Performances as your Lordſhips; and ſince the Advantages, we reap thence, are ſo great, it ſeems unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to debar us of our Acclamations. The Generous and Brave muſt either lye Idle, and not furniſh us with ſuch Charming Subjects for Diſcourſe, or they muſt ſuffer us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ult for the Benefits we thence derive, and not hinder us from giving open expreſſions of our Delight and Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations have, I hope, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to plead my Excuſe, for the boldneſs of this Offering, and give ſome reaſona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </q>
            <p>Beſides, I do not a little pride my ſelf in the Value and Quality of what I Conſecrate to your Lordſhip: This is not like moſt of
<pb facs="tcp:53621:3"/>the Books, now commonly publiſh'd, that reſemble thoſe Eggs incapable of Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Sunt Ova Zephyria,</hi> that produce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Mind, and from whence we cannot derive the leaſt Profit and Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; No, My Lord, this is the Maſter-piece of one of the acuteſt Pens of this Age, tho' the Author had already, by other his Works obtain'd the name of a finiſht Writer, and a perfect Hiſtorian.</p>
            <p>How well he has merited this Title, your Lordſhip will find, all along; by his exquiſite taſte, as to what can pleaſe, or diſpleaſe, tire, or divert; and though he omits nothing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, yet is he Conciſe or Copious, as is moſt Conſiſtent with the due beauty of his Work. Nothing of Prejudice appears in him. He is not warp'd nor cainted by Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Intereſt, or Faction, He blames not, nor Commends, ſo as to make a Satyr, or an Encomium, He ſuffers not Fear or Hope at his Elbow, to jog him on to ſooth the Moderns, or curry-ſavour with Poſterity. His Impartiality being ſuch, that from his Relations, there's no gueſſing at his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or his Religion, or his Friends, or his Party. He is far from imitating even thoſe Great Men, that make Speeches for Perſons long ſince dead, which is degenerating Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory into Romance; tho' ſome will have it,
<pb facs="tcp:53621:4"/>that tho' it be not Truth, it will ſerve out turn as well. But this is the Banner of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels and Poetry, and not the Eſſential of Hiſtory. Beſides, ſuch Decorations and Flouriſhes, are only capable of dazling and amuſing the Mobile; and a Plain, Blunt, Down-right Truth ſhall, in a ſolid Mind, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure all their Luſtre. Not but that his Truths have often the Air of Fiction, but the uſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of ſuch, are the Prerogative of an Ancedoto-grapher. He does not here and there, by ſtarts, make Parade of Wit, but enchaſes it throughout the whole Piece. Nor does he lye perdue, on all occaſions, to be ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in an Elegancy, but ſometimes expreſſes a mighty Thought in one ſingle word, or hints it without ſaying it. Yes, my Lord, theſe <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> all along ſpeak a nice and general Knowledge of Men and of Things, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, Subtle and Penetrating Wit, capable of unveiling the true Cauſes of Humane Actions, from their Pretexts and Colours They are a ſort of Cabinet, Hiſtorical Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, carrying along a Fancy quick and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, conceiving Things aright, and Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifing them afterwards anſwerable to the Conceptions. When my Author's ſubject leads him near a Battel, he has ſo prepar'd his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that they themſelves ſeem ſluſht for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, tho' the quality of his Writing
<pb facs="tcp:53621:4"/>obliges him to wheel 'em off. When he ſpeaks of a Treaty, of the Paſſions of a Prince, or of a Miniſter, his Readers imagine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves enter'd into Negotiation, are agitated with the ſame deſires, the ſame uneaſineſſes and diſquiets. The ſtile of the Original is neither too negligent, nor too ponder'd, but Plain, Chaſte, Perſpicuous and Familia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, yet without being low and crawling, and throughout accompanied with Dignity, yet rather lofty in Sentiments than Words, tho' ſpeaking all the Delicacy of the moſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite Courtiers. For he is ſtill mindful that he entertains all Nations and Ages, that he has the whole Earth for his Audience, and to Eternity ſpeaks before the whole Congreſs of Humane kind, where nothing ought to bolt from him, but what bears the Character of Modeſty, of Recluſeneſs, of Reſpect and Good Manners. And he has herein manifeſted how infinitely he has refin'd upon <hi>Procopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> his Pattern, who has moſt nauſeouſly vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated this Rule in more than a thouſand Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages. And take we him only as he is purg'd and retrench'd by <hi>Nicolas Alemannus,</hi> yet Monſieur <hi>Varillas</hi> has infinitely the Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence over that Antient, without needing to ſupply the befitting Vacuities he has made, by the <hi>Vatican</hi> Copy, to applaud the Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives that <hi>Balthazar Boniface, Trivorius,

And herein my preſent Author has had, as well the good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as the Ability and good Will, to do the World Juſtice; his quality of the <hi>French</hi> King's Library-keeper advantaging him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any other, to ſtrife into Modern Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. And this he has atchiev'd with that Perfection, that there is not a Perſon he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces, but he appears to be acquainted with his every Inclination, and Averſion, and Failure, and weak ſide. He ſhews us whence proceed the Complaiſances, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations, and all the curious meaſures that make an Art of winning Hearts, or, at leaſt, of currying Good Will. In fine, my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, in this his Performance, has the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of <hi>Livy,</hi> the Politeneſs of <hi>Saluſt,</hi> the Policy of <hi>Tacitus;</hi> and had it been the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of an Ancedoto-grapher, could, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, have ſhewn as large a knowledge in Tacticks as <hi>Polybias.</hi>

            <p>And this, I ſuppoſe, is ſufficient to urge is behalf of my Author and his Book. And I will only now crave leave of your Lordſhip, to drop a Word in excuſe of my ſelf, his Interpreter.

            <p>IF <hi>Procopius,</hi> the only Author from whom we have <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> remaining to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had left behind him the Rules of that kind of Writing; I ſhould not lye under the Obligation of Penning a Preface, being the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of that excellent Hiſtorian, whom the <hi>French</hi> King's Preſs has lately preſented ſo Correct to the World, would be ſufficient to ſcreen me from all ſorts of Reproaches, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing I had obſerv'd them with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs.</p>
            <p>But as the Art of writing ſecret Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is ſtill unknown, almoſt in its whole
<pb facs="tcp:53621:9"/>Extent, and no Philoſopher, hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, has taken the pains to draw up the Method of it, nor Critick dar'd to ſhew its Defects, I think my ſelf reduc'd, like thoſe who ingage in new Paths, <hi>viz.</hi> that I take all the Precautions neceſſary, to prevent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing damn'd at the entrance of my Work; and therefore mean to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Laws on my ſelf, according to which, I pretend to be try'd by an equitable Reader, on Condition I neither borrow them from my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon nor Caprice, but only from the Examples of <hi>Procopius,</hi> whom I will ever have in ken, ſeeing I cannot find any other Guide.</p>
            <p>Thus it is, with his Approbation, that I lay down for a Foundation of this Diſcourſe, that it is not ſo eaſie a matter to write <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as People may imagine, becauſe, on one ſide, a Man cannot diſpence himſelf from
<pb facs="tcp:53621:9"/>any of the Rules that <hi>Ariſtotle, Cicero, Plutarch,</hi> and other the Maſters of th' Art have ſo judiciouſly preſcrib'd for Publick Hiſtory; and on th' o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there are many others, which I ſhall relate in the Series of this Preface, which he is no leſs indiſpenſably bound to obſerve; from whence I draw two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, holding of the Paradox. The firſt is, what Liberty ſoever, not to ſay Libertinage, that's attributed to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, there is no kind of Writing more conſtrain'd, nor more reſerv'd, ſince it has not a quarter of the Extent which the moſt ſcrupulous Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans propoſe to themſelves. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, That there's no kind of Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very greater, for an Anecdoto-gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, than to be ty'd to tell the truth in all its Circumſtances, ev'n when he handles the niceſt matters.</p>
            <p>I explain my meaning by ſo known and memorable an Example, that it
<pb facs="tcp:53621:10"/>cannot be queſtion'd. Certain it is, that <hi>Procopius</hi> has perform'd the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a perfect Hiſtorian, when that ſeeking into the Cauſe that made the Emperour, <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> recall <hi>Beliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> out of <hi>Africa,</hi> from whence he had drove the <hi>Vandales,</hi> in three Months ſpace, tho' the preſence of that Great Captain was abſolutely neceſſary to ſettle his new Conqueſt. He writes, that this Service was of ſuch Conſideration, that <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> not finding himſelf capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding it, was afraid leſt <hi>Beliſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> having his Arms in hand, might do himſelf Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Procopius</hi> ſtopp'd there, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had ſatisfy'd the Laws of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory; and certainly there would have been injuſtice in demanding o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> him then any thing further. But when he be thought himſelf, long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to labour upon thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:53621:10"/>fancy'd there was no more Diſguiſe to be us'd upon ſo fantaſtical a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that its moſt concealed Minutes ought to be laid open, and that his Readers Curioſity wou'd not be fully ſatisfy'd, without at leaſt revealing to him that Court Myſtery, which tho' he had caus'd to paſs in the ſecond Book of the War of the <hi>Vandales,</hi> for an effect of a Soveraign's Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Jealouſie towards one of his Subjects, whom Fortune lifted too high, was, properly ſpeaking, only an Intrigue of Love of <hi>Antonina, Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarius</hi> his Wife, ſhe being Cock-a hoop to return to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> there to ſee again the infamous Object of her Paſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Procopius</hi> took the ſame Courſe in his Books of the <hi>Gothick</hi> War, when he had ſpoken of the ſame <hi>Beliſarius</hi> his ſecond or third Diſgrace; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having, with all the vigour of his
<pb facs="tcp:53621:11"/>ſtile, exagerated the Prejudice <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian</hi> did his own Concerns, by degrading that brave General, in the very inſtant he came from taking <hi>Rome,</hi> and delivering <hi>Italy</hi> from the Lording of the <hi>Goths,</hi> by win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Battel, wherein the King and all the Royal Family remained Priſoners; he was contented with writing, that <hi>Beliſarius</hi> his Enemies were ſufficiently powerful, at the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Court, to procure his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal.</p>
            <p>But he ſpeaks much more home in his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, wherein he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that the true and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Cauſe of his Degradation, came from the Empreſs <hi>Theodora, Juſtini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s Wife, who being deſirous to make <hi>Beliſarius</hi> purchaſe the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of his Employment, caus'd him to return to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where ſhe propos'd to him the obtaining his
<pb facs="tcp:53621:11"/>re-eſtabliſhment, on condition that his Daughter, who was to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Heireſs of the immenſe Riches he poſſeſs'd, ſhou'd Marry the Empreſs's Nephew, having nor Eſtate nor Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, nor Birth, <hi>Beliſarius</hi> Sacrific'd his Daughter to his Ambition, and recover'd the Generalſhip at that price; But he kept it but two years: And in this place do I make a third Obſervation upon the Conduct of <hi>Procopius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For tho' he owns <hi>Beliſarius</hi> to have ſurpaſs'd himſelf by recovering the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the reſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> which the <hi>Barbarians</hi> had ſeiz'd on during his abſence, tho' he declaims againſt the harſhneſs of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> and <hi>Theodora</hi>'s Infidelity, who recalled him unſeaſonably for the third time, yet was not he wanting however, when he examines the occaſion of it, towards the end of his ſecond Book,
<pb facs="tcp:53621:12"/>to have recourſe to the ſame Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, he had made uſe of, to explain the foregoing Diſgrace. And 'tis only in his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that repreſenting <hi>Beliſarius</hi> once again upon the Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, he draws the Curtain, and downright avers, that what abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puſht him in it, was, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs had got a Fancy to have his Wife return to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to have a Confident, nay, and a Companion in her Diſorders. The reaſon of ſo different a Conduct, in one and the ſame Author, proceeds, if I be not miſtaken, from that the Hiſtorian conſiders almoſt ever Men in Publick, whereas the Anecdoto-grapher only examines 'em in private. Th' one thinks he has perform'd his duty, when he draws them ſuch as they were in the Army, or in the tumult of Cities, and th' other endeavours by all means to get open their Cloſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door;
<pb facs="tcp:53621:12"/>th' one ſees them in Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and th' other in Converſation; th' one fixes principally upon their Actions, and th' other wou'd be a Witneſs of their inward Life, and aſſiſt at the moſt private hours of their leiſure: In a word, the one has barely Command and Authority for Object, and the other makes his Main of what occurs in Secret and in Solitude.</p>
            <p>Not but that the Writer of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> draws a Picture of Perſons, as exact, and as faithful, at the leaſt, as can be done by the Hiſtorian; but he does it after his own Mode. He repreſents only as much of the Man's Out-ſide, as is neceſſary to know his Inſide; and as the good and bad diſpoſitions of the Mind, are only to be diſclos'd in the Manners, 'tis alſo for the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that he reſerves his livelieſt Colours, and fineſt Materials.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:53621:13"/>
            <p>So ſcrupulous is he in this point, that he minds not provoking the Anger, or incurring the Indignation of the Perſons Concern'd. But he is commonly ſo unhappy, that what ought to paſs for a Virtue, is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him as a Crime. He ſuppoſes for one of his Principles, that fine Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret which <hi>Plutarch</hi> firſt diſcover'd in Moral Philoſophy, namely, That there is no ſtate in Life, wherein a Man is more careleſs to conceal what paſſes in the bottom of his Heart, than when the paſſion that Lords him is arriv'd to exceſs.</p>
            <p>However, when he follows the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Agitations occaſion'd, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, by the fury of Love, and the deſpair of Jealouſie, he is forthwith aſpers'd as a Detractor; and that he only writes a Satyr, wherein his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is much more unhappy, than that of the Painter, who is fully ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify'd,
<pb facs="tcp:53621:13"/>if he can ſhew that his Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traict altogether reſembles th' Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, whereas the Writer of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> has never more reaſon to fear being ill treated, than when what he relates of Viciouſneſs is moſt true.</p>
            <p>I inſiſt upon this point, it being, perchance, that which has diverted Hiſtorians, before and ſince <hi>Procopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> from this kind of Writing, and which, by Conſequence, muſt needs ſet me a trembling. I undertake to draw the Picture of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 7th, and if I deſign to do it to the Life, I muſt detect his Ruling Paſſion, and examine to its leaſt Symptoms. Not a Man, that I know of, has yet ſaid what it was; and I am the firſt that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it to have conſiſted in a blind and whimſical deſire, with which he was ever poſſeſs'd, of raviſhing his fellow Citizens of their Freedom, to raiſe to the Soveraignty of <hi>Florence,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53621:14"/>two Baſtards of his Houſe, though it did not then want ſeveral Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Children, whoſe Heroick acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might have merited the Choice, and whom all Mankind judg'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Compariſon, more capable of filling that place.</p>
            <p>I do not fear being Cavill'd upon this Propoſition, as being ſure there cannot any material Circumſtance be found in the Life of that Pope, but what alludes to this Aſſertion. Nay, I fancy, that if I proceeded no further, I ſhould be ſo happy as to ſcape the on-ſet of Criticks. But have I not reaſon to lye under diſmal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, when the neceſſity of my ſubject ſhall oblige me to grope on, and put Truth in all its Light? When the ſad Deſtiny of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indure any thing myſterious, ſhou'd be left to Poſterity without explaining it, or any thing ſecret
<pb facs="tcp:53621:14"/>without revealing it, ſhall ingage me inſenſibly to take off the Paint, with which Hiſtorians fucuſs'd moſt of <hi>Clement's</hi> Actions, to ſhew how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny weakneſſes and faults againſt true Policy, budded from this firſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, and to explain the minutes of thoſe failings, which paſt, at length, ev'n to the preference of the youngeſt of thoſe two Baſtards, to the eldeſt, tho' the youngeſt had not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the qualities neceſſary for Command and Government, and that the Eldeſt poſſeſs'd them all, by the conſent of thoſe who knew him, and ev'n to the expoſition of <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> only Daughter, and ſole Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs of his Houſe, in a Curb'd, Head-ſtrong, and Rebellious Town, whoſe Inhabitants he had reduc'd to deſpair, by a Siege of eighteen Months.</p>
            <p>Moreover the Writer of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:53621:15"/>makes a ſcrupule of charging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with pompous matters, and as he principally aims at knowing what is peculiar in the Inclinations, he ſtops ſometimes, to glean up ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as were neglected and flung a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide by the Hiſtorian. An unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen Anſwer ſerves him to penetrate into the bottom of Peoples Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. If he had been at <hi>Florence</hi> with <hi>Aleſſandro de Medici,</hi> one bare word of that Duke, wou'd have ſuffic'd him to make his Pourtraict. He wou'd have ſuppos'd that the impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trability of his Secret, his being his own ſole Confident, was it ſelf his true Character, as ſoon as he had heard him ſay, that he was himſelf the Keeper of his own Deſigns; but a Keeper ſo Jealous, that he did not allow 'em to ſtir one moment out of his heart, to take the Air upon the brink of his Lips.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:53621:15"/>
            <p>I ingenuouſly own, that the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian does not do the like, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly do I leave him in poſſeſſion of that fine Maxime of <hi>Adrianus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus, Diſcurrere per Negotiorum Celſitudines non humilium minutias in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagare Cauſarum.</hi> I take it kindly of <hi>Lucian,</hi> for having rally'd thoſe who wou'd go another way to Work, and I blame <hi>Guichiardini</hi> for having ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten violated this Rule; but I pretend likewiſe to be left in my turn, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, peaceably, the Priviledge of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and to relate with a ſerious Air, the ſmalleſt trifles, when they have been th' Origine or occaſion of the greateſt Matters.</p>
            <p>Perhaps I ſhall have the Validity of theſe Priviledges deny'd me, upon that <hi>Procopius,</hi> who has advantag'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of 'em ſo often, has no where ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the pains to eſtabliſh them. But I anſwer, in the firſt place, that tho'
<pb facs="tcp:53621:16"/>it were ſo, I ſhou'd ſtill have left a Poſſeſſion of above twelve hundre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But, after all, tho' I ſhou'd be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of <hi>Procopius</hi> his Authority, I ſhou'd ſtill have a reaſon left, which ought, in my Opinion, to paſs for Fundamental, in the matter now in hand; namely, That notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Writer of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is no leſs oblig'd, than the Hiſtorian, to tell the Truth, yet he is not oblig'd to tell it in the ſame manner; for the Hiſtorian is not properly bound to tell it, but when the Tranſactions he relates are ſo true, as that they are probable; and <hi>Guichiardin</hi> will be ever blamed for having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated<note n="*" place="margin">In the Fifth Book of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</note> the Caſe of two Rival Brothers, th' one of whom having known that

There ſhou'd he have ſtopt, and not have added, that theſe ſame Eyes were remitted in their place, by ſo delicate a hand, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd th' uſe of ſight.</p>
            <p>Yet am I not of their Opinion, who think this ſingle Inſtance ſufficient to make <hi>Guichiardin</hi>'s Proceſs, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict him not only of Falſehood, but likewiſe of manifeſt Error againſt common Senſe. I am willing to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, with the Adorers of this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, that the two Perſons, of whom he ſpeaks, were ſufficiently Eminent in <hi>Italy,</hi> to be known, and that the Place of the Blindneſs and of the Cure, which they are minded to maintain, was not ſo remote from <hi>Florence,</hi> but that a Man might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of it in a ſhort time, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

What I now find fault with is, that ſo Tragical and Capricious an Event, tho' it may be true, was not probable, at leaſt in its utmoſt particularity, which ought to be omitted, or related with the due Precautions, for the perſuading the Reader, that there was no deſign to impoſe on his Credulity.</p>

            <p>But if the Writer of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> has on this ſide, more Liberty than the Hiſtorian, he has it not on another which wou'd be much more material to him: for he cannot propoſe to himſelf or Intereſt or Glory, for the end of his enterprize, and the Field he cultivates is to him ſo uſeleſs, that
<pb facs="tcp:53621:18"/>it produces him only Thorns and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars: He runs a riſque of loſing all, inſtead of profiting; and the ſame <hi>Conaſtagio,</hi> who had been promis'd ten thouſand Crowns, beſides an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Penſion for Life, for writing the Hiſtory of the re-union of <hi>Portugal</hi> to the Crown of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Baſtinadoes, as ſoon as it came to be known, that he elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where than at the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours Houſe at <hi>Genoua,</hi> ſought after Memoirs for writing the late Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Low Countries.</p>
            <p>He wou'd not ſo much as dare to hope to raiſe his Name from Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by cauſing others to revive: and in the Moſt Chriſtian King's Library, have I read ſeveral Manuſcripts, which Infallibly will be never Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe they draw the Picture a little too much to the Life, of ſome Illuſtrious Perſons, in whom Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:53621:19"/>has not hitherto found any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, or at leaſt was not willing to find any.</p>
            <p>He can neither make his Wit nor his Eloquence glitter nor ſparkle, by reaſon thoſe ſorts of Truths that fall within his Sphere, ought neceſſarily to appear ſtark naked, and I do not think there hardly can be found in Antiquity, a more careleſs ſtile, in that kind of Writing, than is that of <hi>Procopius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, he obliges neither the Age, whoſe Errors he recounts, nor that wherein he lives. Thoſe who ought to gain moſt by his Inſtructions, are thoſe who are moſt provok'd in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them; and if the ſtate of <hi>Venice</hi> had not offer'd an Azylum to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate <hi>Boccolini,</hi> there wou'd not have been any ſafety for him in the Old or New World, ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful was then the Pow'r of thoſe,

            <p>I launch out much farther, and aſſert, that there is hardly any Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox in the <hi>Stoick</hi> Philoſophy, but what, by a contrary ſenſe, is verified in the Deſtiny of a Writer of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; he ſearches after Truth with an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable Care, but ever purſues he it unprofitably, he thinks to attain to Felicity, by attaining to Truth, and yet bears off and diſtances himſelf from his own Happineſs gradually, as he approaches Truth; he Combats for it with a world of Pains and Trouble, and yet he never Triumphs after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Vanquiſht. In ſhort, he is the Slave of Truth, as <hi>Epictetus</hi> was of Virtue, he muſt cheriſh it for its own ſake, and never complain of the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs it makes him ſuffer, provided he is Sooth'd and Cocker'd with the hopes of poſſeſſing it.</p>

            <p>Excellent Painters are there, who make Pourtraicts according to all the Rules of Art; and yet thoſe Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicts are not altogether reſembling they add ever ſomething to the Faces they repreſent; and tho' they do not omit any of the Features or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments, they ſo raiſe and ſet off the Air and Colouring, that they are found much handſomer on the Cloth, than they are in th' Original. I do not think there ever to have been any Hiſtorian, that has entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoided this Defect: and this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders me from calling it a Fault. And I cou'd quote an infinite number of Ancient and Modern Examples; but I'le reduce my ſelf to that of <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th, as ſharing in my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>Three Celebrated Hiſtorians are there, who have employ'd all the Strength and Delicacy of their Stile,
<pb facs="tcp:53621:20"/>to expreſs that Popes Genlus to the Life; namely, <hi>Paulus Jovius, Guichi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardin,</hi> and <hi>Padre Paolo Sarpi,</hi> of the Order of the <hi>Servi.</hi> Yet they go ſo different a way to work, that the three principal Heroes of <hi>Italy</hi> are not more different among themſelves in Manners and Conduct, than <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th is from himſelf, in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of thoſe three Authors.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">In his Book and in his particular Eulogy of <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th.</note> 
               <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> makes him paſs for a Man Arrogant and Stately, and ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to carry things with a high hand. To him does he impute the ſame Warlike hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that poſſeſs'd <hi>Giulio</hi> the 2d, his Predeceſſour. He made him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, ev'n before his Exaltationy a diſdainful Contempt of all the reſt of the Sacred Colledge; founded upon an imaginary precedence of the Houſe of <hi>Medici</hi> o're other the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
<pb facs="tcp:53621:21"/>of <hi>Italy;</hi> he cauſes that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to intervene in all the ſignal Actions, and ev'n in the moſt auguſt Ceremonies; he takes him for the Source and Foundation of the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate War againſt the Duke of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> and of other the Quarrels that aroſe in the Pontificate; in a word, he will needs have that Vanity; but a haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhocking Vanity was his predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Inclination.</p>
            <p>If you are concern'd to know how <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> has penetrated ſo far into <hi>Leo</hi>'s Boſom, to pronounce of him ſo deciſive a Judgment, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obviates your queſtion, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that he was that Pope's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that this Holineſs caus'd him to lay aſide the Profeſſion of Phyſick, and the pretenſion of a Chair at <hi>Padoua,</hi> to ingage himſelf in an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical ſtate, made him Biſhop of <hi>Coſmo,</hi> choſe him to be his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,

Wou'd not a Man ſay, to hear him talk in this manner, that he has made the true Pourtraict of <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth.</p>

               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholick, and makes him Triumph, in his Youth, over that old Uſurpers Stratagems. To him it is he attributes the ſecret of making the Council of <hi>Spain,</hi> willy-nilly, back and further all his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
            <p>After having laid down theſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Principles, no glittering Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are there, but what ſet off <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th's Picture. He frames from ten years old, when firſt made Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, thoſe vaſt Projects he ſince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, when exalted to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair. He negotiates with the States of <hi>Venice,</hi> for the ſaving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieving the Wrecks of his Houſe, that had run a ground on the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of <hi>Charles</hi> the 8th. He does not alter his Reſolution, by having ſeen his brother periſh at the Paſſage of a River. He has no other thoughts than for the advancement of th' only
<pb facs="tcp:53621:22"/>Son that Brother left in the Cradle, and thereupon he returns to <hi>Rome,</hi> where his Intrigues give him acceſs to Pope <hi>Giulio</hi> the Second's Favour, and procure him to be Elected Legate in the Army deſign'd to drive the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Italy;</hi> he is taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at the Battel of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> but he makes his eſcape in a Conjuncture fatal for himſelf, ſince that <hi>Giulio</hi> was newly expired: He enters the Conclave, where he ſo improves the young Cardinals Caprice, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving whirl'd their Heads with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of making a Pope of their own Age, that he works their Suffrages to turn in favour of himſelf. He joins with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and husbands their Friendſhip, as long as it is of uſe to him, for the re-inſtating his Houſe in the principal Functions of the Magiſtracy of <hi>Florence;</hi> but as ſoon as Fortune turns her back upon
<pb facs="tcp:53621:23"/>'em, and that he finds their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil not of a humour to ſuffer that he uſurp the Dutchy of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to inveſt his Nephew; he treats with the <hi>French</hi> on that Condition, draws up the famous Concordate, wherein he Fools and Bafles the Wiles and long Experience of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour <hi>du Prat;</hi> he Careſſes <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, as long as that King is in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to do him good; but he has no ſooner rookt and wheadled him out of all he aim'd at, but that he gives him the ſlip, to reconcile himſelf with <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth. He projects with this Emperour, for the re-eſtabliſhing the <hi>Sforza</hi>'s in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan.</hi> He ſucceeds ſooner than he expected, and receives ſuch tydings that ſo tranſported him with joy, as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd his Death.</p>
            <p>Now this is <hi>Guichiardin</hi>'s <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th, a Piece not in the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
<pb facs="tcp:53621:23"/>that of <hi>Paulus Jovius.</hi> Yet it's paſt all doubt, that he was at leaſt as well inform'd; for he came of a Family entirely devoted to that of <hi>Medici;</hi> he was almoſt of the ſame Age with <hi>Leo,</hi> he had been Educated with him, he had accompany'd him in good and bad Fortune, he had manag'd the moſt ſubtile Intrigues of his Exaltation, he had receiv'd extraordinary Honours and Benefits from him, then, by his Order, did he return to <hi>Florence,</hi> where he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the Downfall of the popular Faction, and manag'd the Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Country-men, with ſo much Addreſs, that this Pope, by his means, Commanded nine years in that City, in ſpight of its Liberty. His Holineſs had call'd him thence to honour him with an Office, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was oblig'd to confide in him the moſt important of his ſecrets,
<pb facs="tcp:53621:24"/>by making him Commiſſary Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Armies of the League a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>French,</hi> which he offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated at the very time of that Pope's dying.</p>
            <p>After this, can <hi>Guichiardin</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd, with having wanted ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Inſtructions? And ſhall we not find other Hiſtorians in the laſt Century, much inferior to him in this point, far from being in any wiſe to be compar'd to him? Yet <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre Paolo,</hi> who has labour'd at <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th's Pourtraict, after <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> and <hi>Guichiardin,</hi> has imitated neither of their Stroaks and Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; he repreſents him as a Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Perſon, that pamper'd himſelf with the enjoyment of all the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the Popedom, and waved all its Bitterneſſes, that troubled his head with no knotty nor difficult Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, referr'd to Subaltern Miniſters
<pb facs="tcp:53621:24"/>thoſe which demanded Time and Application, enrich'd his Relations and Servants, not out of kindneſs, but that he might be the better ſerv'd, and the more Careſs'd; made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable Wound in the Church, by the Concordate with <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, and empoveriſh'd St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Patrimony by his Profuſions; Raviſh'd his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of its freedom, out of a Caprice, and minded not to reſtore it, when, after his Brother and Nephew's death, departing this Life without Male Children, there was no one of his Family capable of gaining by the Miſchiefs he had done; made a Preſent to his Siſter of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which the Piety of the <hi>Germans</hi> had deſign'd for the waging War upon the Infidels, committed the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of Indulgences in the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of Upper <hi>Saxony,</hi> to the moſt avaricious of his Courtiers, negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Hereſie of <hi>Luther</hi> in its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
<pb facs="tcp:53621:25"/>and did not ſet about ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Gangrene, till when it was become incurable; had too Libertine Sentiments of Religion, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his head little about another Life.</p>
            <p>I dare not ſpeak my mind of the Reſemblance of this Picture, but yet I know that <hi>Padre Paolo</hi> wrote after the Relations of Ambaſſadors, which the State of <hi>Venice</hi> ſent to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the time of <hi>Leo</hi>'s Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and that thoſe Relations are commonly very exact, and very true, as we have newly ſeen, by that of <hi>Correro,</hi> tho' ev'n Cardinal <hi>Pallavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cino</hi>'s Hiſtory, who has undertaken to refute that of <hi>Padre Paolo,</hi> and ſays nothing againſt what reſpects <hi>Leo</hi>'s Perſon, were not a tacit Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what I have newly noted.</p>
            <p>What will then the Writer of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> do, ſuch as I may be? He will take
<pb facs="tcp:53621:25"/>the Pencil after <hi>Paulus Jovius, Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiardin,</hi> and <hi>Padre Paolo,</hi> but he will uſe neither their Colours nor Ideas. His manner will be wholly new, and whereas others had painted Pope <hi>Leo</hi> in his Habit of Ceremony, he will repreſent him in his Undreſs. He will ſlip in among ten or twelve of the Polite and Topping Wits, who commonly aſſiſted at his Private Recreations, and at his Couzening himſelf into a ſleep, and will take him in his gay Humour, wherein he was, for Example, when he fluſht them the Deſign of the<note n="*" place="margin">It was Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Germany,</hi> in the Collection of <hi>Ornarius.</hi>
               </note> fine Grammar, and of ſome other ſuch like Pieces, which have not perhaps been ſufficiently valu'd, either in their own Age, or in ours, conſidering the delicacy of their Invention. He will go and ſeek him in a <hi>Vaſari,</hi> but the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſari</hi> of the firſt Edition: For what
<pb facs="tcp:53621:26"/>I am going to ſay, has been retrench'd from the others. He will go and ſeek him, I ſay, when he ſometimes delighted in thwarting, and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in condeſcending to <hi>Michael Angelo</hi>'s capricious humour, when he wou'd ſee, againſt his will, his Work before it was finiſht, and that he expos'd his Perſon to the being cruſht under a Scaffold, which <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> caus'd to fall upon him out of ſpight; whereupon this Painter ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving betaken himſelf to his Heels, and not daring to return, he was forc'd to make him Ambaſſador of the State of <hi>Florence,</hi> for the re-incouraging him by that inviolable Character, and that at the firſt Audience he gave him in that Quality, in a Gallery where the Pope receiv'd him with his Cane in hand, <hi>Angelo</hi>'s Fear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubl'd, but needleſly, becauſe all <hi>Leo</hi>'s Anger and Cudgelling were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
<pb facs="tcp:53621:26"/>upon a Chamberlain, who wou'd needs ſhew himſelf imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently Arrogant in ſo odd a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
            <p>In fine, the Writer of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> will make Extracts out of the excellent Letters, of the Cardinals <hi>Bembo,</hi> and <hi>Sadolet,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Silvius Antonianus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence he will borrow Secrets, that have ſcap'd the knowledge of the moſt exact Hiſtorians, and from all thoſe Irradiations together, he frames a Character of <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th, which if it be not as beautiful as the foregoing, will be, at leaſt, as Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>But thanks to his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty's Library; I am not reduc'd to be contented with a ſmall matter; and I have found Memoirs ſtill more Ample, and more Authentick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. Well known it is, that
<pb facs="tcp:53621:27"/>the firſt Soveraigns of the Houſe of <hi>Medici,</hi> could not ſo well conceal their principal Adventures, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Aſhes ſo well cover the flames of their Amours, and the ſmoak of their Ambition, but that there has flown thence ſome ſparks, ev'n to this ſide the <hi>Alpes:</hi> They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver acted without Witneſſes, and tho' they had uſed all the Precautions imaginable to delude Poſterity, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine War that has ſometimes been kindled in their Family, has hardly left us Strangers to the leaſt of their Intrigues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Strozzi</hi>'s there have been, who have taken refuge in <hi>France;</hi> and as their Mother was the nigheſt Heireſs of <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th, their Father, the beſt Friend of <hi>Clement</hi> the 7th; and that they had themſelves been concern'd in moſt of the Revolutions that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd under <hi>Coſmo</hi> the Great, they
<pb facs="tcp:53621:27"/>have Collected ſuch particular Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs, that the World has reaſon to exult for their exactneſs.</p>
            <p>Not but that theſe Memoirs ought to be in ſome wiſe ſuſpected, and that they ev'n bear, in ſeveral paſſages, the Impreſſions of the Hatred, Spight, Jealouſie, and Revenge, wherewith, it cannot be deny'd, but that the Authors were poſſeſſed. But 'tis on this ſcore that I have diſtruſted them, and that I have never believ'd them in the leaſt Circumſtance upon their bare words. I have ever confronted them with their Adverſaries anſwers, and have only allow'd them ſo far Credence, as it has not appear'd to me that thoſe anſwers were ſufficient. In a word, I aſſert nothing, without having examin'd the Contradictions, and whoſoever ſhall take the pains to read the Works of <hi>Ceri, Adiani,</hi> and <hi>Manuce,</hi> three the moſt famous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyriſts
<pb facs="tcp:53621:28"/>of <hi>Coſmo</hi> the Great, he will find therein wherewithal to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie me on that point.</p>
            <p>Now if I have the advantage of the Illuſtrations, which one of the two Parties gives me, to the diſadvantage of the other; if I have weigh'd the divers Intereſts and different Motives, if I have compar'd them with the Circumſtances, and if groping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and walking warily, I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to attain to the knowledge of ſecret Tranſactions, by the means of thoſe with which I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted, I have done in this but what is daily done by Judges, when they are about pronouncing upon the Life, or the Reputation of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, whoſe Crimes are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently averr'd.</p>

But tho' he does not appeal to Hiſtorians, what Authorities ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they may have; nay, tho' he makes profeſſion of writing almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Tranſactions, or at leaſt Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities that were unknown to Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians; yet he does not meddle with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving them, or loading them with Invectives; or as <hi>Thimeus</hi> did, who palliates them inſtead of blackening them. He wou'd diſſemble their Faults, if he cou'd do it without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying his own Knowledge; and when that truth, which, following <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s expreſſion, is the moſt
<pb facs="tcp:53621:29"/>imperious of Virtues, forces him to bring them into Light, he never does it without extenuating them, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing himſelf before hand, for what he is going to do. He knows that there is nothing that ſcapes ſo ſoon, nor ſo eaſily as that truth, that he who firſt taught us that it was in the bottom of a Well, might be ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of having bury'd it there all his Life, and that the proneneſs and ſloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Corrupted Nature to falſe-hood, is no leſs ſlippery than that it has to Love.</p>
            <p>The reaſon which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges him to take this Courſe,<note place="margin">In the ſecond Book of his Library.</note> is drawn from <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> who maintains, that as there are feeble <hi>Geniuſſes</hi> that are tempted to do Miſchief, as ſoon as they know the manner of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, there are likewiſe ſtrong ones, with whom it's ſufficient to repreſent
<pb facs="tcp:53621:29"/>Vice in its moſt lively Colours, to divert them from it. 'Tis for Minds of this laſt ſtamp that a Writer of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> labours, as the Hiſtorian, for thoſe of the firſt. They both tend to the ſame end, tho' they take op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Paths: and the Chymiſt, who gives Antimony to drink, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Corrected its Malignity, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Publick no leſs, than he who compoſes a Medicine of the moſt innocent Simples.</p>
            <p>The Judgment is form'd and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion'd as well by the Contemplation of Evil, as of Good; and if Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was depriv'd of this ſort of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, it wou'd be in a worſe Condition, than the young <hi>Greek</hi> Gentlemen, that went to <hi>Thebes,</hi> to <hi>Iſmenias</hi> his Houſe, to learn to play upon the Flute, becauſe that great Perſonage, after having ſhew'd them the ſecret of Mouthing it, made them
<pb facs="tcp:53621:30"/>hear a Man that plaid very ſorrily, that he might make them know the defects of his Art, at the ſame time he gave them its Precepts.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:53621:31"/>the ſame manner they were in ours, or in that of our Fore-fathers, without thereto adding any thing diminiſhing or changing. Thoſe who have ſcap'd, through good Luck or Cunning, the Puniſhments they had merited, wou'd not ſcape the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy; and thoſe, whom their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample might attract into the like Crimes, wou'd accuſtom themſelves betimes to have, for Poſterity, ſome ſort of Fear mingled with Reſpect.

They wou'd be afraid, as well as <hi>Cicero,</hi> of what wou'd be ſaid of them ſix hundred years after; they wou'd, like him, beſeech Modern Authors not to treat them ill in their Writings; and for the giving them occaſion of doing it, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of Truth, they wou'd put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>There has been found People ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the ſtroak of a Pen, though they were not ſo, or to the remorſes of Conſcience, or the ſeverity of the Laws; and a Prince was ſeen in the beginning of the laſt Century, who, not being to be diverted from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting an Inceſt with his own Daughter, by all the Maximes of the Chriſtian Religion, was efficaciouſly ſo, by the Reflexion he was wrought to make, that the thing could not be ſo well conceal'd, but that it wou'd be known by Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Not but that, ever and anon, there has been found Men generous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, as not to be influenc'd to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe the Truth, either by the quality of the Preſents that were made them, or by fear of the Puniſhments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were threatned. But yet
<pb facs="tcp:53621:32"/>there has been ſo few of them, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in the two laſt Ages, that I have been able but to find out a pair, whoſe Example it will not be perhaps amiſs to relate in this place, for the rarity of the matter.</p>
            <p>Never was there a King that was more concern'd, for what wou'd be ſaid of him, after his Death, than the laſt <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> that wore the Crown of <hi>Naples.</hi> He not only labour'd at winning of Battels, and doing thoſe ſorts of actions which ſavour of the Romance, but he was likewiſe ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to find out Pens worthy of writing them, and capable of embe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing them. Not one famous one was there, but he endeavour'd to gain or corrupt, and all ſuch as were in Repute, receiv'd from him Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Preſents, in whatever Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Europe,</hi> Birth, or Fortune had confin'd them; yet never was
<pb facs="tcp:53621:32"/>yet never was there a Monarch whoſe Infirmities have been better particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lariz'd than his. We are not ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the leaſt of his Frailties, and what avails it to read in <hi>Pontanus, Panormus, Benedicti,</hi> and in ſixty four other Hiſtorians, that he poſſeſs'd all the Noble qualities that form He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes. No body believes 'em, and the World is rather inclin'd to give Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to <hi>Bernardino Cerico,</hi> who attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to him only very common Affections, tho' this <hi>Cerico</hi> is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a very piteous Hiſtorian.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſtruccio Caſtracani,</hi> on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, has been defamed by thirty cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Hiſtorians of <hi>Italy,</hi> ten of whom are of <hi>Florence.</hi> He has been reproach'd with all the exceſſes whereof Tyranny is capable, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reach of Fear: And <hi>Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avel</hi> has writ a piece on purpoſe, in ſo terſe, maligne a ſtile, that he turns
<pb facs="tcp:53621:33"/>into Ridicule, all the actions he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not blame. Yet has he not been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd no more than his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men; and though <hi>Nicolas Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grinus,</hi> who made at the ſame time that Great Captain's Apology was inferiour to <hi>Machiavel,</hi> in all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts that make up a perfect Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian: Nevertheleſs People have jugd'd <hi>Tegrinus</hi> to be the ſincereſt of the two. They have approv'd the Contradictions he puts in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, for the undeceiving thoſe who had been prepoſſeſs'd to the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of Truth; and 'tis now allow'd on all hands, that neither the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Machiavel,</hi> nor that of the other <hi>Florentines,</hi> is receiveable in what relates to <hi>Caſtracani,</hi> as being ſuſpected of deſigning to revenge their Countrey, at leaſt with the Pen, for the Affronts, which it had receiv'd from a General of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb facs="tcp:53621:33"/>who had been its moſt formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enemy, though they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, that this General had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther failures, than what proceeded from his living in a Conjuncture, wherein it was not poſſible to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Military Virtues, by lawful means.</p>
            <p>But as the two Events which I have newly related, are perhaps thoſe only, wherein rigorous Juſtice has been done to oppreſſed Truth, ever ſince Hiſtory was written, it is not to be expected, but by a due courſe of proceeding. The ſhelve is to be avoided, which commonly wrecks thoſe who do not fancy, that too much exactneſs can be uſed, in detecting the moſt ſecret matters. You muſt remember, that though a Writer of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> is more often, and more ſtrictly bound to ſpeak the Truth, than an Hiſtorian, yet he is

            </p>
            <p>For my own part, as I have no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, than to collect thoſe Truths which other Hiſtories have either purpoſely, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of Ignorance omitted, I cannot chuſe but ſay, that the Houſe of <hi>Medicis</hi> has always been accounted Noble, ſince <hi>Florence</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed its freedom of the Emperour <hi>Rodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus the Firſt;</hi> of which their Profeſſion of Merchandize, wherewith they are reproach'd is a Proof, ſince all the <hi>Florentine</hi> Hiſtorians agree, that almoſt all the Gentlemen of their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53621:41"/>Country were engaged in Commerce, and that the moſt conſiderable Families had Factors in the beſt Towns of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was by theſe means that <hi>Coſmo de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici,</hi> ſirnam'd the <hi>Old,</hi> came to be much richer than any Prince in <hi>Italy</hi> of his time: for though ſome ſuppoſe that the famous <hi>Balthazar Coſſa,</hi> who was depoſed from the Popedom, diſcovered to him at his Death where he had hid his Treaſure; this good luck might perhaps lay the Foundation of his Fortune, but did not raiſe it to that height, to which it arrived ten years after, when there was no part of the World, from <hi>Perſia</hi> to <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> that was not ſubſervient to his Traffick.</p>
            <p>The difference of Religions hindred him not from treating with Infidels; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant correſpondence he kept with the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperours then regnant, cauſed thoſe Princes to let his Factors ſettle themſelves in the room of thoſe of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> whom for Reaſons of State they expelled out of the moſt trading places of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer <hi>Aſia.</hi> The <hi>Emirs</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the <hi>Mamalukes</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> facilitated his Tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Silks and moſt precious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the <hi>Mogols</hi> Countrey, and he made ſo good a hand of the needy Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to which the <hi>Paleologi,</hi> Emperours of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:53621:42"/>were reduced, that they ſold him the beſt part of the Jewels, and ſplendid Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, the remainders of the Luxury of the <hi>Juſtinians,</hi> and <hi>Porphyrogeniti,</hi> at very low rates. In a word, he arrived at that Wealth, and Power, that his Countrey-men, though uſed to the ſame immoderate gain, grew Jealous of his Greatneſs.</p>
            <p>The Government of <hi>Florence</hi> at that time was Popular in appearance; but ſo temper'd, that the Ancient Families, which were the <hi>Strozzi, Peruzzi, Barbadori,</hi> and <hi>Albizzi,</hi> bore the principal ſway. They were not indeed very well united among themſelves, but yet agreed in their obedience to him that was eldeſt among them, and perform'd his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands with as much Zeal as if he had been their Soveraign. Hence it came, that their Head found it ſo eaſie to engage them in the ruine of <hi>Coſmo de Medici.</hi> After they had reſolved themſelves to deſtroy him, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the People on the ſudden, and told them, <hi>Coſmo</hi> was the ſole author of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery to which the Republick of <hi>Florence</hi> was then brought; that it was he who kept Men at work at <hi>Lyons,</hi> and <hi>Antwerp,</hi> upon thoſe Manufactures which <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> were wont to ſend for out of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and who by conſequence, under pretence of ſelling better pennyworths, took
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53621:42"/>the Bread out of his fellow Citizens Mouths, to inrich Strangers; that there was not a Merchant in <hi>Florence,</hi> let his credit be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo good, whom he did not ruine, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of prodigious Sums before-hand to thoſe that had occaſion, and by his crafty buying up of the fineſt Silks, and beſt Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon the place, and Tranſporting them at leſs charge, which made him more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably a gainer, though he ſold at cheaper rates; his Factors affording their Goods for leſs by one Third then others, which brought them in ſo much Cuſtom, that all other Warehouſes beſides their own were ſhut up.</p>
            <p>There needed no more then thus to touch upon the Peoples weak ſide, who were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary covetous, to ſtir them up againſt <hi>Coſmo de Medici;</hi> he was preſently order'd to be arreſted, and clapt up in Priſon, where he was carefully guarded to prevent his eſcape. His Enemies ſtopp'd here, becauſe they had not at firſt plotted to do him any further miſchief, imagining, that by keeping him from acting, they ſhould ſufficiently inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt his Commerce, and eſtabliſh their own. But when they conſidered, that no <hi>Euripus</hi> was more ſubject to ebb and flow than the inconſtant humour of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver continued a week in the ſame mind, nor were likely to do otherwiſe now, and that

Upon theſe and the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions, the Priſoners Death was reſolved on, and the fitteſt means to effect it long ſought for.</p>
            <p>Some of the Aſſembly propoſed to try him before the People; and undertook to find out Crimes, and Witneſſes ſufficient to take away his Life. But others, who were more numerous, thought that way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding would be too tedious; and that while they were about it, ſome Diſturbance or other would infallibly happen in the Town, which would be a Means to let him out of Priſon. They reſolved therefore to diſpatch him as ſoon as poſſible; and becauſe Poyſon was the ſecreteſt Means, that was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of. In order to this, <hi>Rodolp Peruzzi,</hi> the Head of that Family, and the moſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable of <hi>Coſmus</hi> his Enemies, was imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to viſit and tamper with <hi>Frederig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But in doing this, he committed a Fault, which No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious in ſuch Intrigues are very ſubject to; he ſpoiled the Buſineſs, by betraying too much eagerneſs to have it ſucceed. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd <hi>Malavolti</hi> ſo conſiderable a Sum of Money at firſt daſh, that, though it were not extravagant in reſpect of the vaſt Riches of <hi>Coſmo</hi>'s Enemies, yet it eaſily ſuggeſted to him whom it was offer'd to, that what they asked of him was of mighty impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſince they were ſo very liberal to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. Upon theſe grounds he anſwered <hi>Perruzzi</hi> in ſuch Terms, as though they were ſomething doubtful, yet made him gueſs, if he were not gained the firſt time, the ſecond or third Onſet at moſt would make ſure of him. <hi>Perruzzi</hi> ſatisfied to have advanced ſo far, gave the reſt of the Conſpirators an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what he had done. But while they were thus preparing the Money and the Poyſon, <hi>Coſmus</hi> himſelf was ſtrangely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53621:44"/>in his Thoughts. He was of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating Wit, as uſually all the <hi>Florentine</hi> are; and the perfect knowledge he had o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Genius and Temper of his Enemies, made him quickly apprehend they would practiſe upon his Life the very ſame way on which they had pitch'd. Upon this Suppoſition he had not eaten one bit of what had been dreſs'd for him in four days; which long Abſtinence ſo weakned him, who was other wiſe of a good ſtrong Conſtitution, that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavolti,</hi> who viſited him from time to time was afraid he would ſtarve himſelf, and ſo make him loſe the Money which was offer'd him. To prevent this, he went into <hi>Coſmo's</hi> Chamber, whither he cauſed his Supper to be brought, taſted the Meat before him and with a chearful Countenance invited him to take part. After they had eaten, they had ſome Diſcourſe, in which <hi>Coſmo</hi> failed not to inſinuate to his Hoſt, That though his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were poſſeſs'd of his Eſtate, yet he had Treaſure ſtill conceal'd in <hi>Florence,</hi> enough to enrich any man who durſt ſet him at liberty Theſe Words made ſo much the more Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on <hi>Malavolti,</hi> becauſe he was not ignorant of the common Report, That his Priſoner, for fear of appearing too rich in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And as weak Minds are always perſuaded by thoſe who ſet upon them laſt, <hi>Malavolti</hi> was eaſily convinc'd, there was more to be got by <hi>Coſmo</hi> of <hi>Medici,</hi> than by <hi>Perruzzi,</hi> For this Reaſon he made it his Bus'neſs now to chear up his Priſoner; and <hi>Coſmo,</hi> in Complement to him, told him, he could the rather wiſh to be rid of his Melancholy, that he might likewiſe contribute ſomething of his ſide to their Entertainment. <hi>Malavolti</hi> replied, he would ſoon cure him if he pleas'd, by bringing <hi>Farganaccio</hi> to dine with him next day, whoſe Company was ſo diverting, that it was impoſſible to be weary of it.

Neither was he ignorant, that it was the making him run the ſame hazard, to impoſe upon him any other ſort of Puniſhment than that of Exile, by reaſon of the Power of his Adverſaries throughout all the Territory of <hi>Florence.</hi> and this it was that braſs'd him for Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

In fine, He knew, that at leaſt without going himſelf, with all the Officers of Juſtice, to free <hi>Coſmo de Medici</hi> out of Priſon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him to the very Territories of another Soveraign, thoſe who aimed at his Life would be ſoon enough on Horſeback to ſnap or kid-nap him upon the Ways; and this made him put that expreſs Clauſe in the Sentence, under pretext that <hi>Coſmo de Medici</hi> his Friends were ſufficiently powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This was accordingly executed with that Diſpatch, as ſtartled the moſt vigilant of <hi>Coſmo</hi> his Friends, and his very Enemies too. The Priſoner knew nothing of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but by the ſignification that was made to him thereof, though he had ſcouting abroad a great number of truſty Spies; and the Keeper <hi>Malavolti,</hi> was much amaz'd to ſee he was robb'd of his Priſoner, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd at the ſame time of all the advantages he might have reap'd from a longer Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.

They appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Rendezvous to <hi>Coſmo de Medici</hi> his Friends in the Monaſtery <hi>de la Reparata.</hi> They agreed upon the neceſſity of procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Supreme Magiſtrate to be choſen that was of their own Body. They Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd in order the fitteſt Perſons for that Dignity, and concluded at laſt upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Nicolo Cocco,</hi> a Friend of <hi>Guadagni</hi>'s. They Cabal'd for the Suffrages the two enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Months in his favour; and as he was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belov'd by the Nobility and the People, they found no great trouble in obtaining them. Not but that <hi>Coſmo de Medici</hi> his Enemies did oppoſe the Election, when he was put into Nomination; but they perceived it ſo late, that they had not the leiſure either to Concert among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or put in practice the Artifices neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to elude it.</p>
            <p>Thus was <hi>Cocco</hi> Elected <hi>Gonfaloniere,</hi> and did not fruſtrate the hopes which the Exiles had conceived of his Fidelity. By little and little, he accuſtomed the <hi>Florentines</hi> to hear them named in Publick Aſſemblies, and in good part to hear them mentioned. Then fell he to offer things in their juſtification, and ſucceeded immediately in what regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>But an accident they had not foreſeen, ſurprized in this point the Delicacy of their Reaſoning: For in a ſhort time after <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagni</hi>'s return to <hi>Florence, Coſmo de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici,</hi> who try'd all poſſible ways for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recall'd, bethought himſelf to ſettle at <hi>Venice</hi> the Center and Staple of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and there have the Manufactures wrought, which were afore ſo done by hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:53621:51"/>way, the Commerce of <hi>Coſmo de Medici</hi> coming to change its Principal Place, made a Ceſſation to that of the Principal Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Florence,</hi> or at leaſt weakned it in ſuch manner, that theſe publick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints were daily heard to ring, <hi>Que Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonne ne gaignoit plus rien, That Trading's now quite Dead.</hi> The other Inconvenience was, that the common People loſing the certain occaſion of dayly getting Money by working the Manufactory, and not finding any body that employ'd 'em in other Works, there was all of a ſudden ſuch a ſtrange Revolution made in Peoples Minds, that the recalling of <hi>Coſmo de Medici</hi> was wiſh'd for by all the Corporations which compoſed the Republick, with ſo much eagerneſs, that his Enemies durſt not traverſe it any longer.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Cocco</hi> had nought elſe to do, than to put this Repeal into Deliberation, and caſt up the Suffrages of thoſe who were to ordain it. <hi>Coſmo de Medici</hi> thank'd the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of <hi>Venice</hi> for the Protection they had afforded him, and return'd to <hi>Florence</hi> with Acclamations that already diſtinguiſh'd him from private Perſons. He received Viſits from all the Orders, and honeſt <hi>Malavolti</hi> fail'd not to crowd in with thoſe who went to Congratulate his Return. <hi>Coſmo</hi> received him with very particular Careſſes, and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavolti,</hi>

               </gap> in a place fitting to receive an Illuſtration of this nature, he pretended not to have ſmelt out any thing new, and reſted ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with telling <hi>Malavolti,</hi> that he knew himſelf eternally his Debtor. Then he turn'd to other Perſons of Quality, who came to Complement him on the occaſion and there the Converſation fell. But as ſoon as <hi>Coſmo de Medici</hi> had got rid of his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits, he went to pay a private one to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavolti,</hi> when putting him again on the Diſcourſe, which he ſaid they had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to interrupt, by reaſon of there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too many Witneſſes, he put him ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Queſtions, and led him through ſo many

Upon this Information <hi>Coſmo de Medici</hi> made his Addreſſes and Complaints to the <hi>Gonfalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niere,</hi> upon which an Order was iſſued out for the taking <hi>Perruzzi</hi> into Cuſtody.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Barrigel</hi> of <hi>Florence</hi> ſeized the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Perruzzi,</hi> who out-fac'd the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but not his Confrontation with <hi>Malavolti.</hi> He own'd the Fact, and then ſeeing they were going to put him upon the Rack, he diſcover'd all the ſecret of the Conſpiracy againſt <hi>Coſmo de Medici.

               <hi>Coſmo de Medici</hi> having rid himſelf of his inemies under ſo plauſible a Pretext, had hardly ought elſe to do, than to reap the fruit which his Fortune had produc'd him.

            <p>His Father had plainly foreſeen that theſe natural infirmities would undermine all the Foundations of the greatneſs of his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and fell about remedying them by all the ways his Policy could ſuggeſt: For at home he had acquired Friends in all the Orders of the Republick, and had engag'd thoſe Friends to maintain him by an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe

He had Cull'd out ſome among 'em to ſerve him for Counſel, and others he appointed for the Execution of what ſhould be undertaken moſt nice or bold, according to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of their Genius and Profeſſion.

            <p>And indeed he had engag'd himſelf in a very tickliſh Buſineſs; but he had the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to get out of it.

This onely produc'd a Decree, That the Houſe ſhould be razed, and its Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants baniſh'd for ever out of the State of <hi>Florence,</hi> without hopes of their Poſterities ever returning thither. This Sentence, thus moderated, wrought the Effect which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attends things of this nature; I mean, it inflam'd the Malady, whereas it ought to have cured it. It gall'd the <hi>Pitti's</hi> in the moſt ſenſible Part, which was that of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to blaſt them for having conſpired againſt their Country, and yet onely impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on them the ſlighteſt of Puniſhments, which ſo Criminal an Attempt did deſerve.

            <p>Theſe People had no ſooner notice of the <hi>Pitti's</hi> Exile, but they became perſuaded, that it was for the Common Cauſe; and what fully confirmed them in this Opinion, was, that they ſaw 'em retire towards <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice:</hi> For as that Republick had ever been conſtant to the Party of the <hi>Guelphs,</hi> they did not doubt but that they were going to re-eſtabliſh 'em, and took the ſame Road, that they might go and join themſelves to their pretended Deliverers.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Venetian</hi> Senate had quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Thoughts, on ſo favourable a Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture which Fortune preſented it.

            <p>They had bent their Deſigns towards the <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> and imagin'd that the Conqueſt of <hi>Italy</hi> would not be impoſſible for 'em to effect, by attacking it the ſame ways the <hi>Romans</hi> had formerly done, ſo to render themſelves Maſters of it: I mean, by falling in with, and fomenting the Diviſions which they found among the <hi>Italians;</hi> whereas heretofore they were the firſt to extinguiſh them.</p>
            <p>I know this Deſign was unjuſt, as the Tyrannick Rigours which they uſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute it,<note place="margin">Paulus Jovius, Guichardini, Albertus, <hi>and</hi> Mongino.</note> did afterwards evince. But methinks the Hiſtorians of <hi>Italy</hi> ſpeak thereof with too much tartneſs, when they term it Chimerical: For after all, the <hi>Venetian</hi> were then in a better Poſture, than the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were when they undertook it. They were abſolute Maſters of their Gulf, and none, no not ſo much as the Emperour and King of <hi>Naples,</hi> durſt croſs it without their leave. The Iſle of <hi>Candie,</hi> which they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd entirely, was its Key on the ſide of the <hi>Levant,</hi> which was the moſt dangerous: and Fortune, to skreen 'em the better from the Enterpriſes of the Infidels, had newly given 'em the famous Kingdom of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which they had hook'd in by Intrigues that would furniſh ample Matter to <hi>Anecdota,</hi> if there
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53621:61"/>was any Pen bold enough to dare to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it. They were no leſs Potent on the <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> ſince that beſides the better part of <hi>Friuli, Iſtria,</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and the moſt delicious Territory of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> which they held, they had ſet footing in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> by the means of ſome Maritime Places, which King <hi>Ferrand</hi> had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to pawn to 'em, for the carrying on the Civil War againſt his Nobleſs. They had got near <hi>Ferrara,</hi> through the Polerain of <hi>Rovigo:</hi> They had purchaſed the ſtrongeſt Places of <hi>Romagna,</hi> by whoſe means they Check-mated the puny Tyrants that poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the reſt of that little Province: They had thrown the Marquis of <hi>Mantoua</hi> into a blind Dependency on their Wills; and the Republick of <hi>Genoua</hi> no longer defended it ſelf againſt 'em with the ſame vigour as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, being the Seditions under which it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, had conſtrained it to ſeek out a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Protection. The Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> could not preſerve the Soveraignty his Father had acquired, but by perſevering in their Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and if the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had nothing to fear directly from 'em, his Territories were not out of the Irruption of the Troops which they had permiſſion to levy in the neareſt Cantons of <hi>Suiſſerland,</hi> and among the <hi>Griſons.</hi>

            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:53621:62"/>
            <p>There onely remained the Republicks of <hi>Florence, Siena,</hi> and <hi>Lucca,</hi> whither the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> had no admiſſion; and as they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to get Acceſs thither by the means of the <hi>Pitti's,</hi> who courted their Protection, they eaſily granted it, in hopes the Civil War that was going to kindle in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> would beget 'em an Occaſion to ſeiſe on <hi>Piſa,</hi> or ſome other Place on the <hi>Tyrrhene</hi> Sea, from whence, by the number of Shipping, which they had much greater than any other State in <hi>Europe,</hi> it would be eaſie for 'em to ruine the Commerce of <hi>Genoua,</hi> and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of that which <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> drove upon the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean</hi> Sea.</p>
            <p>Upon this conſideration they receiv'd the <hi>Pitti's</hi> after a more magnificent Aſpect than they were wont to receive other Criminals; &amp; though the Pretext of their Entertainment was to exert ſome ſort of Acknowledgment to a Family that had oblig'd 'em with ſo many Colonels and Lieutenant-Generals of their Armies, thoſe however who pretended to dive farther into the Policy of the Senate, did affirm, That there was Myſtery in this Reception, and the Conſideration of the paſt, was not the onely reaſon for this Carriage.</p>
            <p>Be it as it will, the <hi>Pitti</hi>'s were defrayed at <hi>Venice</hi> at the Publick Coſt, until they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53621:62"/>had ſettled themſelves to all intents; and though nothing poſitive was ſaid to them, to confirm 'em in the Reſolution they had taken, of carrying the War into the Center of their Country; yet not any of the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect ways were neglected, that could contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to this Deſign. They were given to underſtand, by Emiſſaries ſet privately to work, That the Senate had lived in Peace for ſeveral years with the State of <hi>Florence,</hi> wherewith it had moreover contracted an Alliance, which it could not break, without loſing the Reputation it had acquir'd of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity, and without exciting a general Scandal, by ſo manifeſt a Violation of the Right of Nations; That this Alliance did indeed mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually engage the two Republicks not to give any Aſſiſtance to their Enemies, and not to meddle (in any manner) with the re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of thoſe they had baniſhed; but that it did not deprive the Senate of the Freedom that was natural to it to diſpoſe of its Troops; That it had on foot the braveſt and beſt-diſciplin'd Army in <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> and that it had moreover got into its Service, by an exceſſive Penſion, that famous Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Bartholomi Coglione,</hi> with whom, ſince the Death of <hi>Franciſco Sforza,</hi> not one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon diſputed the Quality of the Greateſt Captain in <hi>Europe;</hi> That though the Senate
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53621:63"/>had all the Reaſons in the World to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with his Services, there was not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, any inconvenience in retrenching him of his Penſion, under colour of the profound Peace the Republick then enjoy'd both by Sea and Land, or to diminiſh it in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as that the General ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with what remained; That in either of thoſe two Caſes, he might handſomly leave the Service, and cloſe with the Party that ſhould be more advantageous to him; That the ſame Pretext would ſerve for the diſmiſſing the better part of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and that they might treat before-hand with the Officers of the Troops which they deſign'd 'em, and Liſt them againſt the time they ſhould be Caſhier'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pitti's</hi> took the hint of what they meant, and being aſſembled with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of the <hi>Guelphs,</hi> they agreed, That the Expedient which had been newly ſuggeſted unto them, was in effect the moſt capable of re-eſtabliſhing 'em in their Country; becauſe that as the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> was then the richeſt State of <hi>Europe,</hi> and that it gave its Soldiers larger Pay than was given by any other <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Potentate, ſhe had ever, by conſequence, the beſt Troops, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd her ſelf by this means in the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſucceeding in her Projects. Thus it
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53621:63"/>was reſolv'd, That the <hi>Pitti</hi>'s ſhould lay their Effects in Tribulation, for the finding out ready Money; and that they ſhould cauſe <hi>Coglione,</hi> and the other Officers of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies that had been mark'd out to them, to be ſounded; and that if he promis'd to fight under their Colours, with the ſame Penſion, in caſe they came to be diſmiſs'd by the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> State, the ſame Emiſſaries ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to retain 'em.</p>
            <p>This ſecret Negotiation had all the Succeſs the <hi>Pitti's</hi> could deſire. <hi>Coglione</hi> having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſmelt out the Senates Deſign, gave Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances of his Service, and likewiſe took upon himſelf to ſollicit the Officers that ſhould be Reformed. Then the Exiles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech'd the Senate to give 'em ſome Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but they were poſitively refus'd: yet, ſome time after, the Republick fell to work on the Reformation of its Army. True it is, that it was not until after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by a ſecret Treaty engaged it in their Intereſts, under whoſe Enſign it had newly liſted it ſelf. <hi>Coglione</hi> was degraded, and he took the uſual Oath to the <hi>Pitti's.</hi> The Soldiers that were Caſhier'd, ſided with the ſame Party their General had choſen; and as there were not then any Wars in <hi>Italy,</hi> thoſe that had a mind to be inſtructed in the Trade of Arms, or had no other Profeſſion,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53621:64"/>flocked from all Parts, to ſignalize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under ſo brave a Captain. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 'em was ſo great, that there was ſeen in a ſhort time upon the Frontiers of <hi>Romagna</hi> and <hi>Ferrara</hi> the braveſt Army that had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in <hi>Italy</hi> ſince that the Houſe of <hi>Anjou</hi> had been drove out of the Kingdom of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> But the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> were too jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and too deeply concerned, to forbear taking umbrage at ſuch ſudden Warlike Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations. The Perſon of <hi>Coglione</hi> was ſo well known to 'em, as to gueſs to what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he made no ſcruple of becoming the <hi>Pitti's</hi> Man, who were onely meer Citizens of <hi>Florence,</hi> after having exerciſed for twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years the moſt Noble and Courted Charge of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army. They held him for an Adventurer, in whom Fortune ſeem'd to ſhew how whimſical ſhe is. He was born in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Bergamo;</hi> and his Family had been totally put to the Sword in the Quarrels of the <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Gibellins.</hi> He had begg'd until eighteen years of age, when that being at <hi>Naples,</hi> and no body daring to diſpute with him the Prize in Wreſtling or Running, by reaſon of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Strength, and incomparable Agility, <hi>Joan</hi> the Second, Queen of <hi>Naples,</hi> who one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valued Men for Vigour of Body, had made him her Minion: But he grew quickly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53621:64"/>weary of that infamous Exerciſe, and ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away from Court, he went to perform his Apprenticeſhip in Martial Affairs under the famous <hi>Braccio,</hi> and ſince under <hi>Franceſco Sforza,</hi> with whom he paſſed through all the Degrees, and then mounted up to the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-Generalſhip, when his Commander made himſelf Duke of <hi>Milan.</hi> Afterwards the <hi>Venetians</hi> enticed him away, to give him the Supreme Command of their Armies; wherein he acquired great Reputation, and ſo much Riches, that the ready Money, he had ſcrap'd together, is ſaid to have amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Two hundred thouſand Crowns; and this Sum was then ſo prodigious, that the <hi>Italians</hi> could by no means imagine that <hi>Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lione</hi> would have rendred himſelf the <hi>Pitti's</hi> Subject, but with deſign of ſubduing the State of <hi>Florence</hi> to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> or to conquer it for himſelf, after the Example of him that had taught him his Trade, who had newly raiſed, upon much weaker Foundations, the moſt topping Soveraignty in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſpread a general Alarm from the <hi>Alps</hi> unto the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea. The <hi>Florentines</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Storm ready to pour down upon them, did what they were wont in the moſt difficult Conjunctures; I mean, they aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the Government of their City to <hi>Piero <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e Medici</hi>'s Friends, who had the principal
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53621:65"/>Intereſt in the Affair. Theſe cauſed the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to aſſemble, put them in Arms, drove away all the ſuſpected Perſons, and made the Exiles be declared Enemies of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick. Afterwards they levy'd Troops, and put them into ſuch Places of their State as they ſaw were likely to be firſt attack'd. But as it was not poſſible to aſſemble in ſo ſhort a time an Army powerful enough to keep the Field againſt that of the Exiles, or to oppoſe againſt <hi>Coglione</hi> a Leader near his Equal in repute, recourſe was of neceſſity to be had to thoſe Powers whoſe Counterbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance maintained at that time what was free in <hi>Italy,</hi> namely, the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the King of <hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have already noted, That the laſt Act of <hi>Coſmo de Medici</hi>'s Life was to acquire to his Son the Alliance of thoſe two Princes. But what had appeared ſo eaſie on the Board, and when there needed only promiſing, became almoſt impoſſible in the Performance; ſo many Obſtacles did there ariſe to croſs it. For, on the one ſide, the King of <hi>Naples</hi> did indeed conſent to grant the <hi>Florentines</hi> part of the Troops deſign'd for the Defence of his Kingdom; but he would by no means yield that they ſhould act joyntly with thoſe of the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> whom he look'd on as his Capital Enemy, and forbid them to have
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53621:65"/>any Communication with them. Nay, he could not ſo much as endure that they ſhould encamp near one another; and tho' they repreſented to him, that it would be giving them over to Slaughter, to expoſe them ſeparated to <hi>Coglione</hi>'s Mercy, who had the repute of being the moſt vigilant Captain that <hi>Italy</hi> had produc'd ſince <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and to ſpend whole N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ghts on Horſeback, for the ſurpriſing of Quarters; tho' it was very eaſie for this General to cut them in pieces after one another, if he came to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that they acted under different Orders: This Peril, how evident ſoever, did not touch the Mind of the King of <hi>Naples</hi> after ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a manner, as the fear of his Soldiers being debauch'd by the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> as they had been in the foregoing Conjunctions for the making War upon the Infidels.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, the Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> ſpoke with great Pomp of the Succours he gave the <hi>Florentines.</hi> He propos'd ſending into <hi>Tuſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> Troops in equal number<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and better equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, than the King of <hi>Naples.</hi> He proceeded further, offering to Head them with <hi>Fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigo d' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino,</hi> whom he kept in his Service, with almoſt the ſame Penſions as the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> gave <hi>Coglione,</hi> and who would make War ſo much the better vpon this General, as for that there was a laudable Emulation
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53621:66"/>between them, which engaged them reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally to practiſe all the Stratagems of the Military Art, to ſurpriſe, and hinder being ſurpriſed. But he pretended before all things, that the King of <hi>Naples</hi> ſhould be bound not to ſend any Fleet into the River of <hi>Genoua,</hi> capable of giving any Jealouſie to the State of <hi>Milan;</hi> with which the <hi>Neopolitan</hi> was the more loth to comply, in that he was extraordinarily provok'd againſt the <hi>Genoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> who had back'd the Revolt of his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons; and beſides, it goar'd him very ſenſibly, in that he muſt receive the Law from his Enemy, for the obliging him to defend an Ally.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the Friends of <hi>Piero</hi> adjuſted theſe Differences ſooner than was expected, and propounded a Temperament which equally fitted the King of <hi>Naples</hi> and Duke of <hi>Milan</hi>'s turn. They aſſured the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> that his Troops ſhould only be employ'd in the defence of <hi>Piſa</hi> and its Territory, where they ſhould not be oblig'd to receive a Companion; which he accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and cauſed them to depart with all expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, under the Conduct of <hi>Galeazzo de St. Severini.</hi> Afterwards, they nick'd their time ſo well to attack his weak ſide, which was Vanity, and repreſent to him how glorious it would be for him to ſacrifice a Deſire of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53621:66"/>Revenge, tho' it was lawful, to the Safety of his Allies; and what a Tarniſh, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, his Reputation would receive, if he hindred the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> to aſſiſt the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> in the War he was going to declare againſt them; that this Prince gave his Word to ſuſpend his Reſentment, until the Peace was re-eſtabliſhed in <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> Thus the Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> having no more Pretext to defer the March of his Auxiliary Troops, and the Friends of <hi>Piero</hi> having gain'd him to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpoſes, by the Offer they made of giving him the principal Honour of the Defence, by confiding in his Troops the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Florence,</hi> he diſpatch'd <hi>Federigo d' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bino</hi> with all diligence, to give order for the fortifying the Suburbs, and caus'd him to be attended by choice Companies of Horſe and Foot, in ſo ſplendid an Equipage, that the like had not been ſeen in <hi>Italy</hi> ſince it had been ravaged by Barbarous Nations. Not a Trooper was there, but had his Led-Horſe, and his Arms enrich'd with all that Luxury had then invented moſt Rare and Curious. The Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets and Corſelets which the Infantry made uſe of were engraven. They had their Trappings deck'd with Cyphers and Devices which noted the Amours and principal Adventures of each Foot-Soldier. Their Swords were adorned with Tufts of Gold in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53621:67"/>Embroidery; and the Guidons and Enſigns diſplayed all the Fineries of Needle-work.</p>
            <p>Theſe Soldiers entred <hi>Florence</hi> in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of Triumphers, rather than of Auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries; and their preſence made <hi>Coglione</hi> change the Deſign of approaching it. But <hi>Piero</hi>'s Friends ſeeing them too curl'd and finical, and too aſſiduous at Balls, to have a good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their Proweſs, thought there was no truſting ſo far in their Valour, as not to raiſe other Troops. They knew that the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick State had ever been a Nurſery of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and that the two moſt Illuſtrious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of that State, namely, the <hi>Colonneſi</hi> and <hi>Orſini,</hi> had accuſtomed themſelves for theſe three Ages to lead Bodies of Armed Men, into the Service of thoſe who would attack or defend themſelves againſt their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, without further troubling their Heads, whether the Cauſe of the Party that called them was juſt, and without examining ought elſe, than the more or leſs Penſions that were offer'd them. They reſolved to gain them to their ſide, and began with that of the <hi>Colonneſi,</hi> who ſtood not upon much entreaty to enter into Treaty with them, for two Reaſons. The firſt is, That being wedded to the Fortune of the Kings of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> they equally followed the Inclination and Intereſt of King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> by declaring
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53621:67"/>themſelves for the Republick of <hi>Florence,</hi> againſt that of <hi>Venice,</hi> becauſe this Prince had propoſed to himſelf, by all manner of means, to obſtruct the Greatneſs of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians;</hi> and wiſh'd moreover, that it ſhould be publiſhed thro' all <hi>Europe,</hi> That he it was that maintain'd the Caim of <hi>Italy,</hi> by ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Ambitious of the Means of aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing themſelves at the expence of others. The ſecond Reaſon was, That the Houſe of the <hi>Colonna's</hi> had ever been the Mark of the Vengeance of the Popes, ſince <hi>Siccara,</hi> one of its moſt ſignalized Captains, had ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Boniface</hi> the Eighth in <hi>Agnania.</hi> This Perſecution had made it cloſe with the Party of the <hi>Gibellins,</hi> and treat as Enemies all thoſe that had declared themſelves for the Soveraign Pontiff. Thus it ſaw it ſelf obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to act againſt the Exiles of <hi>Florence,</hi> ſince they were ſupported by the <hi>Guelphs;</hi> and that beſides, it could not doubt, but that the new Pope, who had newly taken the Name of <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fourth, would contribute with all his Power to the Ruine of the State of <hi>Florence,</hi> which ſerv'd for an Aſyle to ſo many little Tyrants, who had ſeiſed upon the beſt Places of <hi>Romagna,</hi> and of the Dutchy of <hi>Spoletto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was more difficulty to book in the Houſe of the <hi>Orſini's;</hi> for as it was an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53621:68"/>Enemy of that of the <hi>Colonna's,</hi> it was ſufficient for it to ſee the <hi>Colonneſi</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in one Party, to go offer immediately their Service to the contrary Side. Yet they made a ſhift to bring <hi>Virginio,</hi> the Head of the Family, to a Negotiotian, which he did not get out of as free as he entred. They laid him a Snare which he did not diſtruſt, and propoſed to him at firſt the Marriage of his Daughter, that was but twelve years of Age, with <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> who was not yet fifteen. <hi>Virginio,</hi> tho' the eldeſt, was not the richeſt of his Houſe: His Profuſions had utterly ſquander'd what was left of the ravaging of his Enemies; and the Debts he had contracted, already ſurpaſſed the juſt Value of his Lands. Thus it was no ſurpriſing matter to ſee him lend an Ear to a Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeaſoned with all that could ſweeten the Inequality. They lent him Money abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to clear off all Engagements, and ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated that he ſhould pay no Intereſt for ten years. They took his Daughter without any Portion. They aſſured to his Family, in caſe of misfortune, a Retreat near the State of the Church: And, what was moſt advantagious to him in the Iſſue, tho' he little valued it then, they gave him a Son-in-Law, young indeed, but who already ſeem'd to beſpeak himſelf to be one day the Firſt Man of his
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53621:68"/>Age. The Nuptials were not celebrated with much Pomp, as not befitting the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Juncture: There was, however, a world of <hi>Epithalamiums,</hi> among which, that of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelus Politianus,</hi> who being but of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom's years, made Verſes worthy of the age of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> was the beſt received.

The People complain'd of Inconveniencies and Grievances they had not yet felt: they began to ſpeak of the Exile's Power, and in their Diſcourſe to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply the Number of their Soldiers.

            <p>Theſe Conſiderations prevailed in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of <hi>Venice</hi> over <hi>Coglione</hi>'s Reaſons, to whom they ſent a Diſpatch, that it was much better to fix upon <hi>Piſa.</hi> It was no difficult matter for the General to make the <hi>Pitti's</hi> condeſcend to this Undertaking; for tho' they clearly ſaw, that this was not the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt way to be taken for their Return into their Country, they durſt not however de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare openly all they thought of it, becauſe they found <hi>Coglione</hi> too firm in his Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be ſtagger'd; and they lay under the fear, by ſhocking him unſeaſonably, to loſe the Benefit they expected from his Valour.</p>

Nor did he perſevere long in the Reſolution of making himſelf Maſter of it in the Forms; for as ſoon as he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53621:72"/>that 6000 brave Soldiers were got into the Place, commanded by an experienced Head, he judged that it would be the ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Army, without much incommoding the Beſieged, to attack them regularly. Thus his thoughts were wholly ſet upon retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of their Proviſions, and conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Neopolitan</hi> Troops by a Blockade to leave <hi>Piſa.</hi> But while he was heaving and labouring at this, with that indefatigable Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy that made him ſubdue ſo many Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> Fortune, as it were out of deriſion to him, begat the Occaſion of finiſhing the War to his advantage, when he had ty'd up his Hands, as a Man may ſay, and incapacitated himſelf to profit by it.</p>

            <head>THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE HOUSE OF MEDICIS. The Second Book.</head>
            <p>OF all the Houſes that now bear any Soveraign Sway, not one is there that has been reduc'd to ſtranger Extremities than that of <hi>Medicis:</hi> Nor was the Houſe of <hi>Medicis</hi> ever ſo near its Ruine, as in the ſad Conjuncture when young <hi>Lorenzo</hi> became its Head. As he had
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53621:74"/>reaped his Father's whole Eſtate, bating a very ſmall Portion, which fell to <hi>Giuliano</hi> his younger Brother, to ſerve him for Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation, he was likewiſe to undergo all the Charges, which could not poſſibly be more heavy than at that time. Become he was the Head of his Family, and the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Citizen in <hi>Florence,</hi> at an Age when others have ſtill need of ten years Guardian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and his Youth was almoſt equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeable to his Friends and his Enemies. He found he was engaged in a War, which the Riches that came to him by Inheritance could not ſufficiently cope withal, tho' they were immenſe. In the mean while, by all likelihood, the Sequels of this War would be long and troubleſom, ſeeing the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> was a Party concerned.</p>
            <p>Beſides the declared Enemies of his Houſe, that appeared with Sword in hand, to the number of above Twenty thouſand, there was a great many ſecret and unknown ones in the Territory, as alſo in the City of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> who were no leſs to be feared. The People had by their Shrugs and Mutterings ſhewn how weary they were of the War, before they had ſuffered any Inconveniency from it; and gave out, that they would make their Accommodation at their Expence who were the Cauſe or the Pretext of the Diſcord.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:53621:74"/>
            <p>The Auxiliary Troops thought, that their Engagement was ended by the Death of <hi>Piero de Medici,</hi> and acted ſo faintly, as it was eaſie to gueſs, that in a few days they expected to be recalled. The <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alternate Magiſtrates began to deſpair of maintaining the War, and did not believe they were now powerful enough to keep the Factious in Obedience. The Friends of the Houſe of <hi>Medici</hi> had newly loſt the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Union in the Perſon of <hi>Piero,</hi> and durſt no longer act in concert, out of an opinion they had of one another, that each Man meditated the making his Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation apart. In few words, the Danger was ſo great, and ſeem'd ſo inevitable, that there needed the utmoſt Endeavours of the moſt Heroick and moſt Conſummated Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, to triumph over ſo many Difficulties.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took it for his Trial of Skill. And as he borrowed from Hiſtory part of what he was wanting in from Experience, the firſt thing he did was to comport himſelf like a Man that would not only ſupply his Father's Place, but likewiſe that of his Grandfather. The next day aſſiſting at the Council, he made known to the Adherents of his Name, what might reaſonably be expected from a Man of ſuch a promiſing Capacity. He ſpoke his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53621:75"/>Advice with ſuch maturity of Wit as was admired, and began with that happy Addreſs, as to make his Perſon conſider'd like a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Sun. And indeed, that very Afternoon the Council aſſembled at his Houſe, where he ſpoke of the Republick's and of his own Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs with ſo much Prudence, Order, and Neatneſs, that he fully perſuaded thoſe of his Party, that they had gained more than they had loſt in the Death of his Father.</p>
            <p>Then he apply'd his Endeavours wholly to re-eſtabliſh the good Underſtanding which <hi>Piero</hi>'s Death had altered, and to prevent the Advantages which might have thence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued to his Enemies. He cauſed Money to be dol'd among all the Troops that ſerved the Republick of <hi>Florence,</hi> and hindred them by this Gratification from giving ear to the <hi>Pitti</hi>'s Emiſſaries, bribed to corrupt them. He ſpread about a Rumour, That there were Letters intercepted from the <hi>Pitti's,</hi> which named almoſt all thoſe of their Faction that were left at <hi>Florence,</hi> to manage the People in their favour, and that their Perſons were ſuddenly to be ſeiſed on, to be ſerved as Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals of State; and gave ſo many Marks that the Republick would proceed to their Impriſonment, that thoſe who found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves culpable, thought there was no Safety any longer for them at <hi>Florence,</hi> and ſought
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53621:75"/>Retreat elſewhere: Which in two days ſpace caus'd all the Complaints to ceaſe, that were made againſt the Government.</p>
            <p>He accuſtomed the People to deſpiſe the Exiles, and no longer to value the Forces they had aſſembled, by making them obſerve the Fault that <hi>Coglione</hi> had committed, in ſetting upon <hi>Piſa,</hi> in ſtead of marching di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to <hi>Florence;</hi> and ſtarted among them Subjects for pleaſant Diſcourſes, ſo to divert them from the mortifying Tidings they from time to time received, of their Houſes of Pleaſure being burnt. And then, when the Storm was over, and the Country was laid deſolate, he made the Parties concern'd ſo well comprehend the importance of the Injury that was done them, that he rendred them irreconcileable to thoſe who were the Authors of ſuch Devaſtations, and made them as many Soldiers devoted to the Defence of his Party. He with all haſte diſpatch'd away Courriers to <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Milan,</hi> that the firſt News of his Father's Death might be impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there from him himſelf; and the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were immediately followed by Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Note and Truſt, who obtained, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> the Confirmation of the Treaties concluded with his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, and brought new Orders to the Auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary Troops to act vigorouſly for his Intereſts.</p>
            <pb n="72" facs="tcp:53621:76"/>
            <p>The Magiſtrates he re-encourag'd, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring them, that what Soldiers were in <hi>Florence,</hi> ſhould be employ'd to procure them Obedience. He gave the Friends of his Houſe to underſtand, that they ought not to ſeek elſewhere, than in his Perſon, for the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their Union; and made them ſo agreeable a Reproach for entertaining thoughts of knocking off their ſeveral ways, that they cou'd not but bluſh out of meer ſhame; ſo that he brought them again to a good underſtanding of one another. He made them fall again to their former Functions, without the leaſt alteration. He obliged them to declare themſelves publickly in his behalf, for the rendring them the more firm, and to take away from the <hi>Pitti's</hi> the Hopes of corrupting them. In one word, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted all things ſo well, that the Republick did not ſuffer any of the Revolutions with which it had been threatned by his Father's Death.</p>
            <p>But with all this, it would have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to have maintain'd himſelf by his own Virtue, if Fortune had not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpous'd his Cauſe, and if his Enemies, in ſtead of repairing the Fault they had committed, had not augmented it by an unſeaſonable and affected Obſtinacy. All the Rules of the Military Art did required, that <hi>Coglione</hi> in the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53621:76"/>very moment he had the News of <hi>Piero de Medici</hi>'s Death, ſhould have raiſed the Bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kade of <hi>Piſa,</hi> and caus'd his Army to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards <hi>Florence,</hi> to foment the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences which the <hi>Pitti's</hi> maintain'd there, and to be at lurch for nicking the Changes, which according to all appearance could not miſs of happening. The <hi>Pitti's</hi> conjured him to it with Inſtances which might proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have prevailed. They repreſented to him, That the <hi>Piſan</hi> Enterpriſe was no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in terms of ſucceeding; That the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours of <hi>Naples,</hi> that were got into the Town, had removed the principal Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on which it was built, by diſarming the Inhabitants, and diſpenſing them from all Military Functions; That the Place wanted neither Victuals nor Amunitions; That there was no expecting any Diſcord between the Soldiers and the Citizens; and, That as <hi>San Severino</hi> was a Man of Order, he would ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily appeaſe the Quarrels which might ariſe among the Soldiers: From whence the <hi>Pitti's</hi> concluded, That they muſt reſolve on ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole next Winter before <hi>Piſa,</hi> and in the mean while leave the <hi>Florentines</hi> in a State of executing all the Enterpriſes they would frame, after having ſetled their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; or, That they ought to draw nearer to their City, that they might take
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53621:77"/>advantage of the Tumults, which their Friends would not fail of exciting there. However, <hi>Coglione</hi> had no regard to this Remonſtrance, and made appear by his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, that there is nothing more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than the putting ones Affairs into the diſpoſal of a Perſon that has not the ſame Intereſt for their accompliſhment. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Orders of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Senate prevail'd over the General's Duty; and the deſire of augmenting his own Renown, to the coſt of <hi>San Severino</hi>'s, and perhaps alſo of getting by the Ranſom of the richeſt Barons of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> who had put themſelves into the Town, reduc'd all his thoughts to that of ſuffering nothing to go in or out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> being over-joy'd at his Adverſary's fatal Stupidity, loſt not one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Leiſure afforded him. He took care of Affairs abroad, after his terminating thoſe at home, and gave his Father-in-Law Money, to get into the Service of the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> the Troops appointed for the Guard of the Eccleſiaſtick State. He enabled the <hi>Colonna's</hi> to Liſt thoſe <hi>Italian</hi> Forces again, which the <hi>French</hi> King and the <hi>Count de Charellois</hi> had Caſhier'd after the War for the <hi>Publick Good;</hi> and when he ſaw himſelf ſtrong enough to appear in the preſence of his Enemy, he march'd out of <hi>Florence</hi> in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53621:77"/>Quality of Comiſſary-General of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; and leaving all the Honour and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority of the Army to <hi>Federigo d' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino,</hi> he onely reſerved to himſelf the Care of its Subſiſtence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Federigo</hi> did not fruſtrate the Hopes that were conceived of his Valour. He went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly for <hi>Piſa,</hi> with ſo much Reſolution, that <hi>Coglione</hi> (who detach'd himſelf out, for the viewing him the better) doubted the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defeated, if he ſuffer'd himſelf to be coop'd up betwixt the <hi>Neopolitan</hi> Troops which he held inveſted, and the Succours that came to their Relief. To avoid this Inconvenience, which had made him loſe all his Reputation, he raiſed the Blockade with great Order, as well as Diligence. And as he had no great opinion of the <hi>Florentines</hi> Army, becauſe near half of it were new Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies, he encamped in ſuch manner as if he deſign'd to preſent them Battel. <hi>Federigo d' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino</hi> and <hi>San Severino</hi> did not refuſe it, after having joyned their Forces; and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo de Medici</hi> was oblig'd to conſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, tho' he ſufficiently foreſaw, that it was a remitting, to the Diſpoſure of Fortune, the Freedom of his Country, and the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Houſe. The Particulars of this Fight upon the Banks of the River <hi>Riccardi,</hi> in the Territory of <hi>Bologne,</hi> are in all the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53621:78"/>Hiſtories of <hi>Florence,</hi> two excepted, which they have perhaps omitted, becauſe they properly appertain to a Writer of <hi>Anecdota.</hi> The firſt is, That <hi>Coglione</hi> having invented a few days before the way of managing Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery in the open Field, made uſe of it the Day of Battel, with a very whimſical Succeſs; for it had no other Effect upon the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Army, than the taking off Prince <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> of <hi>Ferrara</hi>'s Boot-heel; which all <hi>Italy</hi> complain'd of to <hi>Coglione,</hi> as a manifeſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travention to their Laws and Meaſures of War, in that diſtruſting the Valour of his Soldiers, he had invented the Secret of ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Victory, not finding himſelf capable of gaining it by legitimate means. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Circumſtance is, That the Battel not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning before the Days declenſion, and the Night coming on before it was ended, the Black Guards, Grooms, and Foot-men, and other Creatures of that ſtamp, kindled Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaux, and fell to lighting their Maſters, in ſuch manner as they were wont to do at Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments.</p>
            <p>To neither Side the Victory inclined; and the two Parties having bang'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves weary, tho' with the loſs of very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Blood, retired with an equal Advantage. But <hi>Federigo d' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino,</hi> who would needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine upon the manner of making War, which
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53621:78"/>otherwiſe was then practiſed without any Craft or Artifice, bethought himſelf of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but two hours Repoſe to the Army of <hi>Florence,</hi> and to lead it afterwards, without any noiſe, to attack the Enemies Camp. He came thither at Break of day, and found <hi>Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lione</hi>'s Soldiers ſo faſt aſleep, that it was eaſie for him to take the Quarter which he aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before the Troops appointed for the Guard of the other Quarters were awaked, and put into a Poſture of Self-defence. This Conflict was a little more bloody than that of the Day before: But then, as they did not yet underſtand in <hi>Italy</hi> what it was to kill Men that made no Defence, and asked to be ſet at Ranſom, the Exiles loſt in this Rencounter little more than the Sum of Money, which was employ'd in redeeming the Priſoners. The greateſt Miſchief fell upon <hi>Coglione,</hi> of whom the <hi>Pitti's</hi> had ſo mean and ſlight an Opinion, that from that time they would not confide in him the Command of their Army. But the <hi>Venetians</hi> pretending to be more juſt Eſtimators of Unfortunate Virtue, re-eſtabliſh'd him in the Generalſhip, from whence they had outed him, ſooner than was neceſſary for the retrieving their own Reputation; and by that means perſuading the moſt incredulous Minds out of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion, that he had not ſo abſolutely divorc'd
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53621:79"/>himſelf from their Service, but that he was linked to it by certain indiſſoluble Chains.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pitti's,</hi> that had diſmiſs'd him before they had made ſure of any other to ſupply his Room, did not find out a General ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily as they imagin'd; becauſe <hi>Borſius</hi> of <hi>Eſte,</hi> Marquis of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> on whom they had pitch'd, did not entertain the Offers they made him with all the Heat they deſired. Too Judicious he was not to perceive, that the <hi>Venetian</hi> Senate was really deeper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> War, than it outwardly appear'd. And as he was a Neighbour to that Republick, and had nothing to fear in that Juncture of Affairs, as long as he ſtood in good Terms with it, he had no mind to ſhock it, in conſideration of the <hi>Pitti's,</hi> who had nor Strength nor Credit to re-eſtabliſh him, if he came once to be turn'd out.</p>
            <p>The ſame Reaſon of State hindred the Marquis from declaring againſt the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> ſince they were alſo his Neighbours, and if they had not the ſame facility to ruine him as the <hi>Venetians,</hi> they might lay waſte the Land of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> by cauſing part of their Victorious Troops to live at diſcretion there, and ſo reduce his Subjects to Beggary.</p>
            <p>Yet the extraordinary Civility which he us'd even in his Refuſals, oblig'd him to let the <hi>Pitti's</hi> know, That tho' his Affairs did
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53621:79"/>not allow him to declare for either Party, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Pitti's</hi> not being in an extremely kind Poſture, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their Advantage, made all due Reflexions upon <hi>Borſius</hi> of <hi>Eſte</hi>'s Propoſition. They had not in themſelves either the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make Peace, or to continue the War. They had ſo much the more reaſon to fear the being abandon'd by the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> in that it had already deſpair'd of gaining by their Revolt; and the <hi>Turks</hi> gave it new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>im to be their Mediator, and remitted their mereſts into his Hands. <hi>Borſius</hi> had too much Senſe to take upon him ſo nice an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53621:80"/>without conſulting the Oracle; for ſuch the <hi>Venetian</hi> Senate was then ſtyl'd: He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted them with the Requeſt which had newly been made him from the Exiles of <hi>Florence:</hi> He communicated to them the full Power they head ſent him, and ask'd the Advice of the <hi>Pregadi</hi> upon what he was to do.</p>
            <p>Told he was, That the Senate would be very glad to ſee the Troubles of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> at an end, tho' it were onely to take away all Pretence from Calumny, of divulging (as it did) that they were fomented by the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi> There needed no more, to make <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> apprehend, that the Senate would no longer undergo the Publick <hi>Odium,</hi> by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting Exiles, that were become uſeleſs to them by their Misfortune, and ſuſpected by <hi>Coglione's</hi> Degradation. he took this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for an Allowance, and without loſing time, writ to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> That if they were in a Humour to hearken to Propoſals of Agreement, ſuch reaſonable ones ſhould be made them, as they would be very loth to reject.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> had no ſooner notice of this Offer, but he left his Brother <hi>Giuliano</hi> in his room at the Army, and return'd to <hi>Florence,</hi> where he examin'd with his Friends, whether it was the particular Intereſt of his
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53621:80"/>own Houſe, as well as that of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, to conclude the Peace. So divided were their Sentiments, that there was no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of re-uniting them; but <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> that had ſeen more nearly the Miſchiefs of the War, and was reſolved to put a Period to it ſome way or other, brought over thoſe that were of opinion to have it continued, by repreſenting to them, That things had ſo chang'd face ſince the War began, that they ſhould be infallibly miſtaken, if they reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the ſame Principles; That the <hi>Pitti's</hi> in truth were not to be fear'd, ſince they had ſpent their whole Eſtate, and loſt their Credit; That the <hi>Guelphs</hi> had left them in the lurch; and, that the State of <hi>Venice</hi> was ſo weary of upholding them, that it onely ſought after a plauſible Pretext to take away its Protection from them, without noiſe and ſcandal; That this Pretence conſiſted in the Negotiation whereinto the Marquis of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara</hi> deſired them to enter, and that he was of opinion it ought to be accepted; That it would be for the <hi>Florentines</hi> to bate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Conditions, under which 'twas pretended they ſhould relax a little of the Severity of the Laws; and that, in the mean while, they would derive all the Advantages from a Suſpenſion of Arms, without the <hi>Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti's</hi> being disburthen'd from the Charges of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53621:81"/>maintaining their Troops; That they would not reap any great Fruit from the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Peace, in caſe it was made, as they could hardly become more miſerable than they were, by the continuation of the War; but that the Commonwealth of <hi>Florence</hi> in general, and the Houſe of <hi>Medicis</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, ran a riſque of loſing all, without having any hopes of advantaging themſelves, as long as their Enemies had their Swords in their Hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lorenzo</hi> added other Reaſons of as great moment, to thoſe I have now ſpecified, and made his Friends ſo well perceive, that it was the Duty of a Republick, to allow Fortune the leaſt Lock it could upon it ſelf, that he made them condeſcend to Peace. They went out of his Houſe with this Reſolution, and the next day caus'd it to be concluded in the Council of Eight, That the Intermiſſion of the Marquis of <hi>Ferrara</hi> ſhould be accepted. The Negotiation was of no long duration, and terminated, like all others that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence betwixt unequal Parties; I mean, that it was concluded at the expence of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Side. The <hi>Pitti's</hi> oblig'd themſelves to diſarm, and remain Exiles for Ten years; at the Expiration of which, they ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to return into their own Country, on condition of never more exerciſing any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy

            <p>This City, more Famous in Ancient than Modern Hiſtory, truckl'd to that of <hi>Florence</hi> with ſo much the more impatience, as it had been one of the Laſt that was ranged under its Sway. And the Contrariety of Humour evermore moſt notorious between its Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants and the <hi>Florentines,</hi> made them believe, that there was no Yoke but what was Light, in compariſon of that they bore. Theſe two Cauſes had engag'd them in the Party of all thoſe who had declar'd themſelves at divers times Enemies to the Republick, and had made them open their Gates to <hi>Coglione's</hi> Army, as ſoon as it appear'd before their Walls. They had not been comprehended in the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation, whether the <hi>Pitti's</hi> had not the Power to do it, or had not much inſiſted to obtain it, becauſe thoſe of <hi>Volterra</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd them without exacting from them the haſt Engagement, either by Word of Mouth, or by Writing.</p>
            <p>Thus were they condemn'd by Law-Martial to pay the Charges of the War, and the Principal Officers of the <hi>Florentine</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my prepared to lead their Troops thither.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53621:82"/>
               <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> onely waited for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick's Order to inveſt it; but this Order was not given, for that the Council of Eight could not eaſily reſolve upon the entire ruine of a Town of that Importance. This Council choſe much rather to diſſemble the Fault it had committed, than to apply Fire and Sword to repair it. And the perfect Knowledge they fancied they had of the <hi>Genius</hi> of that ſtubborn People, perſuaded them, by a Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Ratiocination, to wink at their Revolt. They alſo imagin'd, that it would be loſing time, and putting the Authority of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick to the Judgment of Private Men, to demand of them the Principal Heads of the Rebellion, which they would never deliver. And as they were neither willing to expoſe themſelves to the Affront of a Refuſal of that nature, nor puſh on to the laſt Extremity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againſt People they ſaw diſpos'd to expect it, they were of opinion to treat thoſe of <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terra</hi> in the ſame manner they were wont, and to ſhew them by this Conduct, that they had not taken notice of their Revolt.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Lorenzo</hi> made them take up more Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Sentiments, by repreſenting to them, That the Crime of the <hi>Volterrans</hi> could by no mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> be diſſembled, in a Popular State, without expoſing themſelves to the Peril of a ſpeedy Revolution; That there was no City
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53621:82"/>in the Territory of <hi>Florence,</hi> but would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, upon the firſt occaſion, the Example that had been newly ſet them, if they were not diverted from ſo doing by the Quality of the Puniſhment under which they ſhould be laſh'd; and that Clemency was the Rock whereon all Republicks, without excepting that of <hi>Rome,</hi> had ſuffer'd Wrack, becauſe they were not in a Condition to practiſe that Virtue with as much ſecurity as Kings. He added, however, That Indulgence ſhould be us'd towards thoſe of <hi>Volterra;</hi> but that they muſt firſt of all acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unworthy of it, and in craving it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert their Humility.</p>
            <p>Theſe Reaſons were indeed drawn from the profoundeſt Policy; but they were not the ſole, not even the principal, that made <hi>Lorenzo</hi> act in this manner. He had more particular and more preſſing ones, which repreſented to him, his Honour and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ereſt were both almoſt equally engag'd in the Enterpriſe of <hi>Volterra;</hi> the Burgers of that City having made mighty goaring Railleries, and infamous Satyrs, on the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his Youth, and his too great Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with <hi>Angelus Politianus,</hi> and the Study of Polite Learning, to which he was a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender, contrary to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Italian</hi> Gentlemen. Moreover, the War of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53621:83"/>
               <hi>Pitti's</hi> had not laſted long enough to hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel his firſt Arms. There had been onely one Battel, wherein he acted meerly in Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a Voluntier, and under the Orders of <hi>Federigo d' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino.</hi> A Soldier he was known to be; but there was ſtill room for ſuſpicion, whether he was a Captain, until he was ſeen at the Head of an Army, act of himſelf, and put happily in practiſe what he had read in good Books. The Neceſſity of his Affairs, and the Occaſion his Friends had for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Preſence in the Country, did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to ſeek Employment among Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and all <hi>Italy</hi> enjoy'd at that time a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Tranquillity: Wherefore in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> was he to ſeek whereon to make his Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeſhip; and as it was not fitting, or hardly poſſible in a Private Perſon, to raiſe a new War in his own Country, at leaſt without incurring the Publick Abomination, he was to husband well the Occaſion of doing it, that offer'd it ſelf, for the attaining the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage aimed at, without receiving any Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. In few words, <hi>Lorenzo</hi> knew that the <hi>Pitti's</hi> had not acted ſo much againſt the <hi>Florentine</hi> Republick, as againſt him; and held himſelf, by conſequence, the more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound to hinder their ſtirring for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Yet this could not be prevented, as long as they had the Conveniency of ſuch a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53621:83"/>City as <hi>Volterra,</hi> very conſiderable of it ſelf, and near <hi>Florence,</hi> to ſerve them for an <hi>Aſylum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, the Siege of <hi>Volterra</hi> was reſolv'd on; and the ſame <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> who had had ſufficient Credit to get that Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe undertaken, had likewiſe ſufficient to procure to himſelf the Commiſſion of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it. He Inveſted the Place with the Troops which the <hi>Florentines</hi> kept in Pay, diſpoſing the Attacks with Regularity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, at a time when hardly any thing was underſtood of Military Architecture. The Beſieged, who had run themſelves into this Tempeſt through their own Imprudence, ſuſtain'd it with more firmneſs than was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. They ſpoke neither of Capitulating nor Surrendring, and did on that occaſion what could onely have been expected from the moſt obſtinate Citizens of Old <hi>Rome.</hi> They defended their Town to the very laſt Extremity, tho' they had not any hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reliev'd; and when People ask'd them what they meant to do, they return'd an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That they intended nothing elſe than the deferring their Slavery for ſome Months. But in ſhort, thoſe who had yielded neither to the Violence of their Adverſaries, nor to Laſſitude and Wearineſs, ſunk under Famine, and deliver'd all up on Diſcretion. The
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53621:84"/>Mercenary Soldiers of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> who already were all preparing to put them to the Sword, and then ſeiſe on their Eſtates, were ſtrangely ſurpris'd, when they ſaw they were fruſtrated of their Pretenſions by their General's Addreſs.</p>
            <p>And indeed, it was neither the Intereſt nor the <hi>Genius</hi> of <hi>Lorenzo</hi> to abandon <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terra</hi> to Plunder: For beſides the Loſs the <hi>Florentine</hi> Republick had ſuffer'd thereby, that Perſon would ever have been look'd on as Sanguinary, under whoſe Orders the Place had been deſolated: Whereas by preſerving it from the Licentiouſneſs of the Soldiers, a Man might promiſe himſelf the Applauſe of all Degrees in the Republick, when the State of <hi>Volterra</hi> ſhould have put a period to the Averſion which the <hi>Florentines</hi> harbour'd for its Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>This Reflexion was ſo much the more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, in that there was not at that time any People who with more levity skipp'd from Hatred, apparently irreconcileable, to Love, than that of <hi>Florence.</hi> And <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> who had already experienc'd it more than once, in the War againſt the <hi>Pitti's,</hi> did of his own proper motion an Action of Clemency to the Enemy, which he foreſaw muſt needs be made up and reconcil'd in proceſs of time, tho' it was not eaſie to bring it to paſs in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53621:84"/>the poſture things then were reduc'd to.</p>
            <p>The Army he commanded, was not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be confided in by him; for beſides the Regulated Troops, ſeveral Companies in it were of <hi>Banditti,</hi> who had not ſubjected themſelves to the Fatigues of the Siege, but in the hopes they had entertain'd of Plunder. It could not otherwiſe be expected, but that theſe <hi>Banditti</hi> would contemn the Orders that ſhould be given them to abſtain from Pillage, and mutiny, ſo to have a Pretext to enter <hi>Volterra</hi> in a fury. This made their General uſe a Stratagem, which they too late found out, to prevent being deluded by it. As ſoon as he was inform'd, that the Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men reſolv'd to hold out no longer, he feign'd a Deſire to raiſe the Siege, and Caſhier'd the Men for which the State had no longer any occaſion. He cauſed a general Muſter to be made of his Army, and reform'd ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies as he diſtruſted. Their Commanders complain'd openly, That they were robb'd of a Pillage that was their due, and caus'd the Aſſault to be ſounded: but they found Troops that <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had made ſure of, poſted upon the Avenues, that ſtopp'd them in their Carrier, and conſtrain'd them to be jogging back to <hi>Romagna,</hi> there to continue their Robberies.</p>
            <p>Then did <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> enter <hi>Volterra,</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:53621:85"/>granting the Inhabitants their Lives and Fortunes, and onely excepting out of the General Pardon ten or twelve of the moſt culpable, that were hang'd. He us'd the reſt with all poſſible Moderation and Charity, and conſtrain'd them to praiſe him for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been their Deliverer, ever againſt their Wills. The <hi>Florentines</hi> did for their part what <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had foreſeen. His Conduct they blam'd at firſt, for having ſav'd (as they ſaid) their moſt irreconcileable Enemies: But they did not remain three days in ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable an Opinion. They quickly own'd, That as it had been neceſſary to uſe Severity towards the <hi>Volterrans,</hi> when they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to caſt off the Yoke, it was fitting he ſhould change his Method, after the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of a long Siege had convinc'd them, by their own Experience, of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of avoiding the Domination and Authority of the <hi>Florentines.</hi> Thus that People ratified all that <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had done, and decreed him Honours at his Return, which he made appear how much the more worthy he was of, in that he refus'd them without Diſdain, and without ſo much as Affectation.</p>
            <p>Having ſettled his Reputation by Arms, he bent his Thoughts and Endeavours during Peace to the Eſtabliſhment of his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53621:85"/>And as he had already two Sons born, he deſign'd his Brother <hi>Giuliano</hi> for in Eceleſiaſtick, tho' he had not any diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereunto: For bating the time he ſpent is Turnaments, in which he commonly won the Prize, Sloth and Impurities ſhared the Hours of his Life. Otherwiſe, he was of Stature tall, of an advantagious Shape, and ſhew'd ſo much Wit and Courteſie, that his Brother imagin'd he would infallibly change, if he came to be exalted to a Dignity which requir'd his carrying himſelf with leſs Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs. That of Cardinal appear'd at that time very commodious for this Deſign, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the Popes having not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought themſelves of conferring it upon the Children of Soveraigns and Imperial Princes, Magnificence and Luxury had not then got admittance into the Sacred College, nor did they look upon thoſe Vices as its Principal Ornaments. Beſides, the High-Prieſts had not yet figured to themſelves, that their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was wounded, in putting Affairs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into Deliberation in the Conſiſtory, and reſolving upon them by the number of Suffrages: From whence it came, that each Cardinal had as much Buſineſs as was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for a Perſon of his Rank, not to be idle, if he would weigh Matters juſtly and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, about which he well knew his Advice would be required.</p>
            <pb n="92" facs="tcp:53621:86"/>
            <p>Thus <hi>Lorenzo</hi> fell to Intriguing in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of a Cap for his Brother, and employ'd ſuch puiſſant Sollicitations to Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fourth, as to have reaſon to believe, it would be granted him at the approaching Promotion: For he did not content himſelf with the good Offices of the Republick of <hi>Florence,</hi> whoſe Recommendation had ever been much regarded at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> in all ſuch like Conditions of Affairs; but he likewiſe cauſed the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> to intercede, whom his Holineſs took a pride to oblige on all Occaſions. Nevertheleſs, the Pope was inflexible, and refus'd the Cap in ſuch terms, as took away all hopes of obtaining it, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Life-time. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> nettl'd at the Affront, which was inſeparable from ſuch kind of Refuſals, laid hold on the firſt Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion that Fortune preſented him withal, to be reveng'd; and did it with a Succeſs that had like to have ruin'd him and all his Houſe, by the Intrigues and Snares I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to repreſent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fourth had been a poor <hi>Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> of <hi>Savona,</hi> to whom Cardinal <hi>Beſſarion</hi>'s Eſteem had acquired the Dignity of Cardinal. The wonderful Talent and Knack he had at Preaching, and the extraordinary Zeal which carried him to maintain the Immaculate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53621:86"/>of the Mother of God, had inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him into the Party of thoſe who valued themſelves upon a particular, and (as I may ſay) ſingularis'd Devotion. Afterwards, he mounted to the See of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with Cardinal <hi>Borgia,</hi> and the hopes the Latter had of obtaining the Abby of <hi>Sublac,</hi> and other rich Benefices, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the Suffrages of a very powerful Faction in the Conclave, which he diſpos'd of in Quality of Cardinal-Nephew.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Sixtus</hi> never troubled his Head about concealing his Failures, as being no longer afraid of their injuring his Fortune. And it was obſerv'd, a little while after his coming to the Papacy, that he was agitated with a Warlike Spirit, directly contrary to his Auguſt and Heavenly Character, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd with ſuch an Ambition to aggrandize his Family, that he did not value violating the Laws, or conniving at the moſt extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Licentiouſneſs, provided he raiſed it out of the Duſt, wherein it had been buried.</p>
            <p>This Ambition ſeemed ſo much the more ſtrange, in that it from the very beginning paſſed over the Barriers his Predeceſſors had put to theirs, in what regarded their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: For, whereas they had reſted ſatisfied with delivering them out of Miſery, in caſe they were oppreſs'd, or in helping them to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53621:87"/>maintain their Family, by Conſideration, if it was Illuſtriot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He had nine Nephews; namely, five of his own Name, <hi>della Rovere,</hi> who were Children of his three Brothers already dead; and four that went by the Names of <hi>Riari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Afterwards, he had the richeſt Benefices con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd on him, that fell vacant; and ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful was he rendred, that he had the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Train of any of the Sacred College. But his Defects were ſo great, that Fortune alone could neither correct nor cover them: for, on the one ſide, he was ſo prodigal, that the Revenues of the Papacy could hardly cope with his hideous Expences; and in his time it was they firſt ſaw at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Days of the Ancient <hi>Caeſars,</hi> a Man who conſumed in two years ſpace Two hundred thouſand Crowns, which he had got from his Uncle, and Sixty thouſand he had bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd.

            <p>Contrariwiſe, his Brother <hi>Geronimo,</hi> on whom the Pope had caſt his Eyes, to make him his Principal Heir, was more ſevere, and had no fondneſs for any other Divertiſement than that of Hunting. He loved Action to that degree, that after his rate of talking, there ſeem'd not to be any Affairs in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick State, of moment ſufficient to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy him.

He had been ſo cajoll'd by the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> that this Prince had match'd him with <hi>Caterina Sforza</hi> his Natural Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and the Pope, in conſideration of this Alliance, had ſent on the very Wedding-day a Cardinals Cap to the youngeſt of the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Sons of that Duke, call'd <hi>Aſcanio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Riario</hi> had nothing more to do to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat his Eſtabliſhment, than to ſet footing in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbria,</hi> from whence it would have been eaſie for him to ſpread himſelf into <hi>Romagna,</hi> and perhaps likewiſe into <hi>Tuſcany:</hi> but as he had no Troops, and that a great deal of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was needful for the neceſſary Levies, his Uncle made no ſcruple of ſetting to ſale the Offices of the Chancery, and the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which under the preceding Popes had ever been the Reward of Ability, or Virtue. He created five Colleagues, through whoſe Hands all Expeditions of the <hi>Datary</hi> muſt paſs ſucceſſively, and nine new Offices in the Apoſtolick Chamber, that were purchas'd at exceſſive Rates. He made no Reflexion ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the ignominious Commerce he was going to introduce, on the honeſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty he was about to ſtrip the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> of, or the Inconveniencies that would enſue from the time when a ſtop would be put to the Labour and Induſtry of the moſt refin'd <hi>Italians,</hi> by retrenching gratuitous Dignities,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53621:89"/>which ſerv'd them for a Bait, and enkindled their Emulation. He augmented the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Impoſts, and created new ones. He cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated extraordinary Tenths, and likewiſe brought an Army on foot whereof the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>de San Piero</hi> accepted the Legation, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſatisfie his Warlike Humour, than out of kindneſs to <hi>Riario,</hi> whoſe Proſperity he could not look upon without Envy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Federigo d' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi> was requeſted to accept of being General; and to engage him to act the more heartily, they changed his Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Quality of Count, into that of Duke. They diminiſh'd the Duties and Arrears he Annually paid to the Apoſtolick Chamber, in Fealty for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino.</hi> They fetch'd him to <hi>Rome,</hi> to receive the Honours commonly paid to Crowned Heads; and they caus'd him to go with the Cardinal of <hi>St. Peter in Bonds,</hi> to inveſt the City of <hi>Loddi,</hi> it being deſign'd for the firſt Flower of <hi>Riario</hi>'s ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Monarchy. <hi>Loddi</hi> held out, and was taken by Aſſault, yet without being plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd: They proceeded no farther than De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimating the Inhabitants, and ſav'd their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates in conſideration of him who was to be their Maſter.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Spoletto</hi> had almoſt the ſame Fate, and was ſubdu'd with ſo much the more eaſe, in that thoſe of <hi>Riario</hi>'s Faction
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53621:90"/>prevailed over the other Burgers, who had ſet themſelves at Liberty; but they met with more Reſiſtance at <hi>Citta di Caſtello,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Nicola Vitelli,</hi> the Proprietor, ſhew'd more Reſolution, and was better aſſiſted. His particular Union with <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> made him implore the Succours of the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine</hi> Commonwealth, which refus'd him it publickly, at the ſame time that it granted it in private, becauſe <hi>Lorenzo</hi> on the one ſide would not come to an open Rupture with the Pope, and on the other, was overjoy'd to revenge himſelf of the Affront he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, by ſupporting a Juſt Cauſe, and divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Danger wherewith his Country was threatned, ſuppoſing <hi>Riario</hi> ſhould ſeiſe on <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, the new Duke <hi>d' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino</hi> and the Cardinal-Legate were conſtrain'd to frame a Regular Siege before <hi>Citta di Caſtello,</hi> and ſee the braveſt Troops they had rais'd, moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der away before that Place. However, they gain'd it at length, tho' it was not till after three Months Circumvallation, and on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions more honourable to <hi>Vitelli</hi> than to the Beſiegers, ſince they were reduc'd to let him continue ſtill in the Place, in Quality of a Private Gentleman, by purchaſing at a dear Rate the Lands he poſſeſs'd in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood. He had the Value of them paid
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53621:90"/>him down on the nail, before the Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was executed; and this ready Money enabled him to recover ſome time after, by Surpriſe, <hi>Citta di Caſtello,</hi> to drive ſhamefully thence <hi>Riario</hi>'s Garriſon, and raze the Citadel they had begun to build in that Place.</p>
            <p>The Pope, who had been long enough <hi>Vitelli</hi>'s Friend, to know him to the very bottom of his Soul, and judge, that he would not have been capable of making ſo ſubtle a Treaty as his was, or recovering ſo ſoon what he had loſt, if <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> had not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted and prompted him under hand: the Pope, I ſay, conceiv'd ſuch a ſpite againſt <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> as he could not diſſemble: So diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult is it to diſguiſe the Paſſions, when they are arriv'd to an Exceſs. He fell into a kind of Frantick Fit, at the firſt news that was brought him thereof; he turn'd pale with Fury; he wept; he loſt his Stomach, and remain'd ſome days without daring to hold a Conſiſtory.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Florentines</hi> he complain'd thereof, in Terms highly injurious to <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> which menac'd him with ſomething very hideous and fatal: but the Re-eſtabliſhment of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telli</hi> had been manag'd with ſo much Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Secreſie, that the <hi>Nuncio</hi> reſiding at <hi>Florence</hi> could never produce againſt <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo</hi> other than ſuch weak Conjectures as
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53621:91"/>fell preſently of themſelves. Thus all the Satisfaction the Pope obtain'd, was made up onely of moſt humble and obedient Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and <hi>Lorenzo</hi> was abſolv'd after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſufficiently glorious to confound his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers. <hi>Vitelli</hi> remain'd peaceable in <hi>Citta di Caſtello,</hi> the Pope having no more Armies for the Beſieging it again; and his Holineſs, in whom this Diſgrace had onely augmented the Deſire of aggrandizing <hi>Riario,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that he was to proceed in that Deſign by ſuch ways as created fewer Enviers, and were not ſo ſubject to Obſtructions.</p>
            <p>The firſt that offer'd it ſelf, was that of the Acquiſition of <hi>Faenza;</hi> and Fortune onely ſtarted it, to have the pleaſure of ſhamming <hi>Sixius</hi> once again. This City ſerv'd exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a Center to his old Deſign, for that it was ſituated in the midſt of the Government, which he pretended to found for his Nephew, in the Provinces of <hi>Romagna, Tuſcany,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbria.</hi> It had already, for ſeveral Ages, belong'd to the Houſe of the <hi>Manfredi's:</hi> But <hi>Aſtorre,</hi> who then held it with the Title of Soveraignty, had been ſo prodigal in his Expences, that his Revenue being uncapable of paying the Intereſt of what he ow'd, his Creditors had had recourſe to the Apoſtolick Chamber, and had caus'd him to be ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd in Quality of one owing Fealty to the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53621:91"/>Holy See, for the being reimburs'd their Principal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſtorre</hi> appear'd by his Attorney, and deſir'd time: But as his Spoil was ſo conſiderable, as to oblige his Judges to become Parties againſt him, his Eſtate was call'd in by Out-cry, and adjudg'd to his Creditors for Thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns, in caſe they were not paid in forty days after the ſignification of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>The Creditors had agreed with the Pope to make over their Rights to <hi>Riario</hi> for the like Sum; but <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had no ſooner notice of it, but he reſolv'd to break the Bargain. Not but that he foreſaw, there needed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to make the Pope's Fury burſt out, and hamper himſelf in a Buſineſs that would laſt as long as the Life of him he was going to ſhock: Nevertheleſs he proceeded in it; whether he thought he had already ſo incens'd Pope <hi>Sixtus,</hi> that no Meaſures were any longer to be kept with him; or that he accounted the Acquiſition of <hi>Faenza</hi> by the <hi>Riario's</hi> ſo prejudicial to <hi>Florence,</hi> that not onely his Riches and his Life, but alſo the State, were to be hazarded for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of it. And indeed he underhand procured People to let <hi>Aſtorre</hi> know, That if he would treat with them, and give them a Procuration in right Form, they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53621:92"/>to acquit it, without making him loſe his Soveraignty. <hi>Aſtorre</hi> receiv'd them with open Arms, abandoning to them all his Revenues for Twenty years, in conſideration of an Annual Penſion of Two thouſand Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats, on condition to diſcharge it, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering a Power, by whoſe favour they went immediately to ſummon his Creditors to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Reimburſement.</p>
            <p>The Pope having not in the leaſt dream'd, that <hi>Lorenzo</hi> durſt provoke him once again, did not believe that <hi>Aſtorre</hi>'s Engagiſts acted in good earneſt. And as his Pericranium was eaſily poſſeſs'd with certain things, he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd that <hi>Aſtorre</hi> had made uſe of this Slight, to obtain ſome days longer Reſpite. To no purpoſe was <hi>Riario</hi>'s Repreſentation, That it was convenient to have recourſe to ſome For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities and Quirks of Law, for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Signification of the Engagiſts; he continu'd fix'd to have the Creditors taken at their Word, ſo to render their pretended Colluſion the more ridiculous. But when the Act of their Conſent was taken, and they preſſed to agree on the Day and Hour of Payment; when they had given them the Choice of <hi>Species,</hi> and told them out the Money; then the Pope's Hatred againſt <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo</hi> broke out ſo much the more, in that he had retrench'd himſelf of all Judiciary means
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53621:92"/>to hinder the Reimburſement. However, it became him to put a good face on't in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and chearfully conclude the Affair, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a fitter Opportunity to make <hi>Lorenzo</hi> feel the Recoil and Counter-ſtroke of the Acquiſition he had prevented.</p>
            <p>Here would be the Place to relate the <hi>Pazzi's</hi> Conſpiracy, which was onely the Product of thoſe two bold Actions <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> had newly done. But <hi>Politian,</hi> the greateſt Humaniſt, and a Man the moſt skill'd in Polite Learning ſince its firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment in <hi>Europe,</hi> hath given us ſo fine and pathetick a Deſcrption of it, that it is almoſt impoſſible to add any thing thereunto. Thus I ſhould be obliged to tranſcribe it Word for Word, or abridge it, as the Hiſtorians of <hi>Florence</hi> ſince have done, without excepting <hi>Franciſco Nero</hi> the Lawyer, who exercis'd his Talent upon the ſame Subject, by Queen <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine</hi> of <hi>Medicis</hi> her Order. But as this is denied me by <hi>Procopius,</hi> I can adventure no farther than to ſet down here ſuch Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of that Conſpiracy as have been omitted, and borrow from Hiſtory ſome Incidents, neceſſary for the weaving them all into a Piece.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Franceſco Pazzi</hi> was ſuch another Man, as <hi>Catiline</hi> repreſented by <hi>Saluſt.</hi> He had all the good and bad Qualities of that <hi>Roman</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:53621:93"/>Adventurer, and principally that of not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving blunted in Debauchery either the Viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of his excellent Wit, or his innate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſing Humour. His Family was rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd among the Beſt of <hi>Florence,</hi> and his Father left him vaſt Riches, which onely ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd for ſome few years the Luxury of his Table, and his other Diverſions. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of borrowing anew, reduc'd him to leave his Native Country, and go to <hi>Rome,</hi> where the moſt extraordinary <hi>Genius</hi> he had at inventing new Impoſitions, under plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Pretexts, firſt introduc'd him into the Knowledge, and then into the Pope's Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and Truſt. By means of this Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity, <hi>Pazzi</hi> ſtepping from Concerns of the Bank into thoſe of Policy, and ſeeing the Pope in the utmoſt rage againſt the Houſe of <hi>Medici,</hi> and in the fatal Diſpoſition that Hatred muſt have attain'd to, for the becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inveterate and irreconcileable; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to him the exterminating it, by an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt that might inſtate the Family of the <hi>Riario's</hi> in the Place the <hi>Medici's</hi> held at <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi> I ſhould not dare to ſay this, unleſs I had <hi>Onuphrius</hi> for my Warrantee, a Learned <hi>Auguſtin</hi> Friar, entirely devoted to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> That <hi>Sixtus</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd the Overture, on condition that after the Murther of <hi>Lorenzo</hi> &amp; <hi>Gluliano de Medici,</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:53621:93"/>a kind of Governement ſhould be ſettled at <hi>Florence,</hi> in which all things ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated according to the Intention of the Holy See; and that the Pope to avoid the Scandal all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> would receive, if it appear'd, that his Holineſs, who ought onely to harbour Thoughts of Gentleneſs and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, after his Example from whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd all his Authority, had trolled in his Underſtanding ſo black a Crime, and of ſo long Execution, he caus'd the Model of it to be drawn up by his Nephew <hi>Riario,</hi> and commanded him in ſecret to concert it with <hi>Pazzi,</hi> and take all the Meaſures neceſſary for the bringing it about.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Riario</hi> and <hi>Pazzi</hi> agreed, That the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe was of ſuch a Conſequence, that the bare Forces of the Eccleſiaſtick State were not ſufficient to buoy it up; and that before all things, it was neceſſary to hook the Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> and the King of <hi>Naples</hi> into the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. The Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> would have been much more proper for ſuch a Buſineſs, by reaſon of the Neighbourhood of that Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and of the eaſineſs of receiving thence Proviſions neceſſary for the ſurpriſing <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> and carrying on the War. But this Prince had the Imputation of keeping his Word with ſo little exactneſs, that there was no likelihood of embarking him in an Affair,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53621:94"/>of which he would have become the Maſter, as ſoon as he ſhould have been truſted with the Secret; beſides, he was ſo fickle in matter of Averſion, as well as of Friendſhip, that there was no relying on his not treating with his Capital Enemy, an hour after having conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Ruine.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Naples</hi> was farther diſtant from <hi>Florence,</hi> and more bewildred in Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Matters; but, in recompenſe, had a Sanguinary Diſpoſition, and by conſequence more ſuſceptible of the Deſign they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inſpire him with. Moreover, he hated the Houſe of <hi>Medici,</hi> ſince it had the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to ſound him upon a Match of <hi>Lorenzo</hi> with one of his Legitimate Daughters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he married <hi>Clarice Orſini.</hi> In ſhort, there were Troops at <hi>Naples,</hi> which were to be Shipp'd in order to their putting in Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into <hi>Santori,</hi> the Siege of which Place the <hi>Turks</hi> had been conſtrain'd to raiſe; and thoſe Troops might advance towards <hi>Tuſcany</hi> without giving ſuſpicion, becauſe the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of St. <hi>Peter</hi> was bound to defray part of them.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, the Pope was beſought to ſend to <hi>Naples</hi> ſuch a truſty Man, as ſhould ſo ſweetly tickle King <hi>Ferrand</hi>'s Humour in the moſt ſenſible part, by perſuading him, that the Scope of the Revolution they meant
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53621:94"/>to introduce into the <hi>Florentine</hi> Republick, was onely to re-eſtabliſh the Kingdom of <hi>Eſtruria,</hi> whoſe Scepter ſhould be ſway'd by his Natural Daughter, for whom he had more affection than for the reſt of his Children; that might make him conſent to what was deſired of him. The Emiſſary that was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch'd to him, puſh'd on the Point much further: for, to hamper him in ſuch manner as that this timerous Prince might have no pretext to go back, he made him ſend the Duke of <hi>Calabria,</hi> his eldeſt Son, into <hi>Tuſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> under the Sham of folliciting new Aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Arrears of Pay owing him from the Commonwealth of <hi>Florence;</hi> but, in effect, to be upon the Spot when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy ſhould break forth, and to fix by his Authority, and the Renown of his Valour, thoſe who had not yet determined what they had to do, or elſe to draw in the Principal of the <hi>Florentine</hi> Nobility, who would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe declaring againſt the Houſe of <hi>Medici,</hi> unleſs they ſaw they were abetted by a Prince of that Conſideration.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> began the Journey that was enjoyn'd him, without knowing what he was going about, they having judg'd him too Sincere and Generous to take upon him ſo ſhameful a Commiſſion, if he had penetrated into the Myſtery of the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53621:95"/>He was onely given to underſtand, That he went to Head thoſe Forces, whom the Pope had given good Quarters to in <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magna,</hi> that ſo his Preſence might oblige them to live with more reſervedneſs. But <hi>Ria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi>'s and <hi>Pazzi</hi>'s extended ſtill much farther. The Cardinal-Nephew's continual Riots had ſquatted him in his Coffin at twenty eight years old; and the regret <hi>Riario</hi> had for his Brother's untimely Death, did not hinder him from endeavouring to keep his Benefices and Dignities in his Family. To that intent, having not yet any Boys out of the Cradle, he bethought himſelf of making young <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facle Sanſonio,</hi> his Siſters Son, go by the Name of <hi>Riario,</hi> and preſented him to the Pope to fill the Place of Cardinal-Nephew, tho' he was as yet but ſeventeen years of age. The Pope, who could deny <hi>Riario</hi> nothing immediately preferr'd that young Man into the Rank he deſired; and <hi>Riario,</hi> to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Good he had newly procur'd him, ſent him into <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> under the maſque of perfecting his Studies at <hi>Piſa,</hi> which for Law at that time was the moſt celebrated Univerſity in <hi>Italy.</hi> But in truth, he had laid his Meaſures ſo well, that the young Cardinal <hi>Riario</hi> was to take a Journey to <hi>Florence,</hi> without any other Intention on his part, than of viewing that fair City; tho'
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53621:95"/>
               <hi>Riario</hi>'s aim was for him to be there juſt at the time the Conſpiracy ſhould be executed, that: ſo his Preſence might animate ſuch of the Plotters as were irreſolv'd or fearful, and bring all the Authority, which <hi>Pazzi</hi> judg'd neceſſary, for the Conſummation of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy.</p>
            <p>There remained nothing more than the gaining <hi>Franceſco Salviati,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> by reaſon of uſing the Credit he had at <hi>Florence,</hi> and to have upon all Events and Occaſions a Retreat into his Palace. Old <hi>Pazzi</hi> took upon him this Commiſſion, and perform'd it almoſt without any trouble, by reaſon that the Reſemblance of their Amours and Fortune had engag'd them in ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar an Union, that they blindly eſpous'd one anothers Paſſions and Caprices. They were both of an age, and they were created Knights on the ſame day: They made no Profeſſion of any Virtue, either Moral or Chriſtian; they plaid perpetually at Dice, ſwore confoundedly, and ſhew'd no reſpect to Religious Matters.</p>
            <p>But beſides this Society of Debauchery and Riot, two Reaſons there were, that faſtned the Archbiſhop of <hi>Piſa</hi> on the Undertaking. Firſt, Becauſe that in the purſuit of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick, which he had got by Cabal, by Flattery, and other irregular Courſes, which
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53621:96"/>were then more in uſe in <hi>Italy,</hi> than they had been for nine or ten Ages afore, this Prelate had met with no greater Oppoſition than what came from thoſe two Brothers <hi>de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici,</hi> tho' he had ſurmounted them at length, by the <hi>Pazzi</hi>'s Credit at the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Reaſon was, That to nooſe this retchleſs and voluptuous Spirit in an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe which requir'd ſo extraordinary an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, they were forc'd to ſooth him with the Honour he would acquire by declaring himſelf the Deliverer of his Country, and aſſuring him, moreover, of a Cardinal's Cap at the firſt Promotion.</p>
            <p>Now, they had nothing more to do, than to aſſemble, in a Place convenient, for the drawing up the Model of the Conſpiracy; and <hi>Giacomo Pazzi</hi> offer'd for that purpoſe his Houſe of Pleaſure at <hi>Montuglio,</hi> where the Principal Accomplices met, under ſhew of a Hunting-Match. There it was concluded, That <hi>Franceſco Pazzi,</hi> who had lately inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated himſelf into the Confidence of <hi>Giuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano de Medici,</hi> through the Hopes he had given him of favouring him with a Lady whom he extremely lov'd, ſhould mind him to perſuade <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> that tho' their Houſe had no great reaſon to be ſatisfied with the Pope, yet it was becomingly handſom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Firſt Rank he held at <hi>Florence,</hi> to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53621:96"/>treat the Cardinal-Nephew, tho' it were onely to teſtifie to the People, That his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment was quite over, for the Rebuff he had met with at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſuppoſed <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> would immediately take the Cue, becauſe they knew, the two Brothers lived in ſuch Unity, that the one had no ſooner explain'd his Mind upon Honeſt, and even Indifferent Things, than the other conſented to them: Beſides, his Humour was ſo naturally prone to Magnificency, and to paying that ſort of Devoirs, that Decorum and Civility exacted frem Perſons elevated above the Common Rank, that there needed nothing elſe to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe him efficaciouſly thereto, than the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing him with the Occaſion. Thus, as they ſuſpected it would be in one of their Country-Houſes that theſe two Brothers would receive the Cardinal-Nephew, to make him the better relliſh the Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Seaſon; it was concluded, that his young Eminency ſhould be conducted by one half of the Conſpirators, who ſhould ſnap the Opportunity of aſſaſſinating the two Brothers in the midſt of the Feaſt; while the other half, that were to ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in the City, ſhould with the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's aſſiſtance excite the Sedition, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to riot the People, by making their
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53621:97"/>Ears ring with the pleaſing Word of <hi>LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERTY.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Franceſco Pazzi</hi> perform'd his Commiſſion in the very firſt Viſit he paid to <hi>Giuliano de Medici:</hi> For, after the Compliment at en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, he civilly beſought him, with a jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cund tone, to tell him the Day that his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and he had choſen for the Regale of the Cardinal-Nephew, becauſe his Uncle being willing to do them the Honour of being the firſt to treat his Eminency, was preparing to invite him on the morrow. <hi>Giuliano</hi> was a little ſurpris'd, and bluſh'd at this Queſtion, by reaſon of the Coldneſs that was between his Brother and the <hi>Riario's</hi> on his account; however, he made anſwer, That his Brother had not as yet ſpoke to him of it, expecting the Cardinal-Nephew to tarry ſome time at <hi>Florence;</hi> but that nevertheleſs they would that Night diſcourſe the Point together. And indeed, <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had no ſooner notice that the <hi>Pazzi</hi> were to entertain the Cardinal-Nephew, but he thought it behov'd his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be beforehand with them. He took his Meaſures with his Brother for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and gave the neceſſary Orders towards the preparation of a magnificent Feaſt in the Houſe of <hi>Frejola,</hi> which he judg'd more commodious than his other Seats of Pleaſure. The Cardinal-Nephew was invited, his Day
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53621:97"/>ask'd, and he oblig'd to appoint it, after he had for a long while very handſomly excus'd his ſo doing; and <hi>Giuliano de Medici</hi> let <hi>Franceſco Pazzi</hi> know it.</p>
            <p>The Conſpirators made all ready with ſo much the more eaſe, in that the very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they meant to aſſaſſinate, furniſh'd them in the nick of time with all the Precautions they needed to keep, by informing them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do the Honours of his Houſe. But the Day being come, <hi>Giuliano</hi> was ſeis'd with ſuch a Defluxion upon his Eyes, and with ſo troubleſom an Overflowing of Flegm upon the Stomach, that it was impoſſible for him to quit his Bed. <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> ſeeing his Mien ſtrangely alter'd, was far from preſſing him to riſe; but ſent for the Phyſicians, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd them to have a care of a Health that was no leſs precious to him than his own, taking Horſe immediately, to get to <hi>Frejola,</hi> before the Company he was there to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain.</p>
            <p>He came out to meet the Cardinal, and accoſting him with a Countenance on which ſomething ſad was eaſie to be diſcern'd, he begg'd his Pardon for being there alone to pay him that Office. He accus'd the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that had befallen his Brother; he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd his Circumſtances in ſuch Terms, as
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53621:98"/>almoſt madded the Conſpirators, as acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by what whimſical Adventure For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had robb'd them of one of their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctims. But as there was no remedy, they were forc'd to compoſe their Looks like Men who had no other Thoughts than thoſe of Recreation. At the very firſt they had agreed not to execute their Enterpriſe by halves, becauſe that one of the two Brothers remaining alive, would have been ſufficient to maintain the Advantages of his Houſe in the Republick of <hi>Florence.</hi> Thus, the <hi>Paz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi's</hi> having a little recollected themſelves from the Amazement in which they were plung'd by <hi>Giuliano</hi>'s abſence, had nothing elſe to do, than diſpatch one of their Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Piſa,</hi> to let him know the Diſappointment, that ſo there might be no unſeaſonable and ineffectual Commotions in the City.</p>
            <p>The Feaſt at <hi>Frejola</hi> was very Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> ſpar'd nothing of what might ſerve to perſuade the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal-Nephew into an Opinion of the profound Reſpect he had for the Pope, notwithſtanding all paſt Tranſactions. The Cardinal-Nephew, who knew nothing of the Perſonage he was put upon acting, had the leſs trouble to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Delicacy of the Meats, and the Exactneſs wherewith they were ſerved. The
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53621:98"/>Conſpirators were not able to conſtrain themſelves with ſo much Artifice, but that it would have been eaſie for <hi>Lorenzo</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that they were extremely unhing'd, if his ſollicitude for his Brother's Illneſs had left him all the freedom of Mind that was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to him, and if he had had leſs application to what he did. He acquitted his Share of it with much politeneſs, and the Cardinal-Nephew departed from <hi>Frejola,</hi> equally ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the Courteſie and Good Chear of his Harbinger.</p>
            <p>By this Diſappointment the Conſpirators were not diſcourag'd from their Attempt: And as <hi>Giuliano</hi>'s Fluxion was ſpent in a few days, they fancied his Brother and he wou'd not fail of being on the <hi>Sunday</hi> following, the twenty ſixth of <hi>April,</hi> at the Great Church, tho' it were onely to accompany the Cardinal-Nephew, who meant to ſee its Ceremonies. Upon this, they fram'd a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Project, for the aſſaſſinating the two Brothers <hi>de Medici</hi> in the Temple. The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of the Plot, beſides the Majeſty of the Place, could not be more execrable; ſince they took for a Signal the auguſt moment of the moſt awful among the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries; I mean, the time when the Prieſt ſhould lift up the Hoſt. Then <hi>Antonio Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terra,</hi> and the Governour of the young Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53621:99"/>
               <hi>Pazzi,</hi> call'd <hi>Signiore Stephano,</hi> engag'd to kill <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> with their Poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, while <hi>Franceſco Pazzi</hi> and <hi>Bernardo Bandini</hi> ſhould by the ſame Courſe diſpatch <hi>Giuliano.</hi> The Archbiſhop of <hi>Piſa,</hi> follow'd by <hi>Giacopo Poggio,</hi> Son to the Tutor of the two Brothers <hi>de Medici,</hi> and accompanied by the greateſt number of the Conſpirators, and all <hi>Salviati</hi>'s Kindred, that were in great Conſideration, undertook to ſeiſe at the ſame time the Town-houſe, under pretext of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting <hi>Ceſare Petruzzi,</hi> who lodg'd there in Quality of <hi>Gonfaloniere.</hi> And old <hi>Giacopo Pazzi,</hi> at the very inſtant he ſhould have word brought him of the two Brothers Death, was to take Horſe, adorn'd with his Collar, and march directly to the principal Place, where all the Friends of his Family ſhould wait for him in the poſture of Armed Men, to afford Aſſiſtance to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Piſa,</hi> if he ſtood in need of any, againſt the Town-houſe.</p>
            <p>For the better ſecurity, <hi>Franceſco Pazzi</hi> would needs know of <hi>Giuliano de Medici,</hi> whether his Brother and he would not be at the Temple; and <hi>Giuliano</hi> made him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That they would not fail of paying their Attendance. And indeed, the Hour and Day being come, <hi>Lorenzo</hi> was there one of the firſt, as deſigning to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53621:99"/>of <hi>Penitence</hi> and the <hi>Fuchariſt:</hi> and the two Men appointed to aſſaſſinate him, went and planted themſelves by him. But they had already begun to ſing the Anthems Introductory to the Maſs, when as <hi>Giuliano</hi> did not yet appear; whether his Good <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> had made him change his Deſign, or that he had ſpent too much time in Dreſſing: The Conſpirators were very uneaſie on this account, and they already fancied their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe diſappointed, becauſe that failing the ſecond time, it was morally impoſſible to keep it ſecret, conſidering the multitude of thoſe that were privy to the Plot: When that <hi>Franceſco Pazzi</hi> bethought himſelf of a Trick, which accordingly did his Buſineſs. He took his Companion <hi>Bandini</hi> along with him, and ſcour'd immediately to <hi>Giuliano</hi>'s Apartment-door. They found him buſie a curling his Hair, and ſaluted him with a Countenance that could be neither more jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cund, nor more calm. They check'd him after a merry, gay, and facetious manner, for his Sloth; and <hi>Franceſco Pazzi</hi> taking him aſide, told him, his Miſtreſs was at Church, ſo beauteous, and well dreſs'd, as chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd the ogling of all the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. This Hint entirely vanquiſh'd <hi>Giuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano</hi>'s Reſiſtance, and ſurmounted the laſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle that his good Demon interpos'd to his
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53621:100"/>Misfortune. He made ready with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; and thoſe two Murderers, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe of ſeconding his Impatience, ſerv'd him for <hi>Valets de Chambre.</hi> Then they took him under the Arms, and conducted him in that poſture to the Church, where they were no ſooner arriv'd, but the Prieſt lift up the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Hoſt, and unwittingly gave a Signal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by the Conſpirators, for the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the moſt hideous of Sacrileges.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pazzi</hi> and <hi>Bandini</hi> ſtabb'd <hi>Giuliano</hi> to death with their Poigniards, and did the like to <hi>Nori</hi> his Domeſtick, as he was going to draw his Sword. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had not come off at a cheaper rate, had the others faln upon him at the ſame Inſtant: But as his Murderers were not ſo diligent as his Brother's, whom he already perceiv'd they had Poigniarded, that ſad Spectacle made him draw his Dagger with his Right Hand, and wrap up his Left Arm in his Cloke. When he was attack'd by <hi>Antonio de Volterra,</hi> and by <hi>Steffano</hi> the Prieſt, he defended himſelf with a Preſence of Mind that wrought his Safety: For, tho' at the very firſt he receiv'd a Wound in the Neck, from whence there guſh'd a great deal of Blood, he parry'd ſo long, that his Friends, who being back'd by ſome couragious Prieſts, had the leiſure to joyn him, and cant him into a Veſtry, that was accidentally open,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53621:100"/>ſhutting the Door upon him before <hi>Bandini</hi> could reach him, who ran after to diſpatch him out-right. In the mean while, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Piſa</hi> came to the Town-houſe, and ask'd to ſpeak with the <hi>Gonfaloniere.</hi> The Porter made anſwer, He had order to let no Chriſtian in, for that the <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> was newly ſet down to Dinner with the Captains of the Wards, whom he had invited. The Archbiſhop was a little ſtartled at this Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which he had not foreſeen; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of the firſt Sham that came into his Head, he replied to the Porter, That he muſt neceſſarily ſpeak with the <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> at that very inſtant, as bringing him Orders from the Pope, that could not be one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deferred. The Porter did ſo much the more eaſily believe what the Archbiſhop told him, in that he ſaw an extraordinary Attendance; and without making further Reflexion, went to tell the <hi>Gonfaloniere,</hi> That the Archbiſhop of <hi>Piſa</hi> had a Brief to deliver him from his Holineſs. The <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> thought it very ſtrange, that this Prelate ſhould come and importune him at a time, when People are not wont to treat of Serious Matters. However, as it was unhandſom to deny him Admittance, he roſe from Table, went to receive him, and led him into an Upper Room. This was done ſo in a trice,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53621:101"/>becauſe the <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> was afraid of making his Gueſts wait, that the Archbiſhop had not the leiſure either to reſolve in himſelf, or to agree with his Accomplices, after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he ſhould back the Lie they had paum'd upon the Porter. From thence it came, that when the <hi>Gonfaloniere,</hi> after the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments, ask'd him for the Brief he brought from the Pope, he not onely made no poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Anſwer, but furthermore, the Crime he was involv'd in preſenting it ſelf then to his Imagination, with all its Blackneſs, diſturb'd him in ſuch manner, that he cou'd not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear bluſhing and turning pale at the ſame time, nor ſhewing by frightful Looks, and a ſtammering ruffl'd Speech, part of what he had in his Mind.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Gonfaloniere,</hi> a Man exceeding diſtruſtful, (as are commonly all <hi>Florentines</hi>) ſuſpected that Ambuſcades were laid for him; and leaving the Prelate dumb and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, ruſh'd out of the Chamber, to call the Soldiers which the Republick maintain'd for the Guard of his Perſon, and of the Town-Houſe. <hi>Poggio,</hi> who went in with the Archbiſhop, wou'd have with-held the <hi>Gonfaloniere;</hi> but this Magiſtrate being ſtronger than he, knock'd him down with his Firſt, and made but two Leaps to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Dining-room, and give his Gueſts
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53621:101"/>notice to ſeek their Safety in the Dungeon. He made them pop into it, and ſtood upon the Steps, to defend and ward the Paſſage with a Spit, which meer Hazard put into his Hands.</p>
            <p>The Conſpirators that attended the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, out of reſpect ſtaid all at the bottom of the great Stair-caſe, except <hi>Poggio,</hi> who had taken him under the Arms, to help and uſher him up; and had divided themſelves into the Hall of the firſt Story, which ſerv'd for the Meetings of the reſpective City-Companies or Guilds, for fear their Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſhould give Umbrage, if they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd all together. Whereupon, a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is to be remark'd, which having been omitted by the <hi>Florentine</hi> Hiſtorians, renders their Narration obſcure and defectuous; namely, That the <hi>Gonfaloniere's,</hi> when they entred upon the Magiſtracy, were wont to cauſe all the Wards of the Town-houſe Locks to be chang'd: And <hi>Ceſare Petruzzi,</hi> who had then that Character, and valu'd himſelf upon being an Engineer, had caus'd them to be made with ſo much Artifice, that the Doors, upon the leaſt touch, ſhut of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but could not be open'd without the Keys, which by conſequence remain'd ever tied to the Porters Girdles.</p>
            <p>Thus, in the very moment that the <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faloniere</hi>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:53621:102"/>call'd for Help with an hideous Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry, the Hall-doors of the firſt Story came to be ſhut up, and the Conſpirators caught (as it were) in a Trap. The People, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclin'd to Superſtition, were afterwards perſuaded that the thing happen'd miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly; and <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> did not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his Head much to undeceive them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was for his advantage, that his Country-men were of opinion, that Heaven concern'd it ſelf moſt viſibly in preſerving the Race of <hi>Medici.</hi> But it's more ſafe to attribute the Cauſe of this Event either to ſome one of the <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi>'s Domeſticks, who having his Mind leſs poſſeſs'd with Fear than his Camrades, bethought himſelf of pulling to the Doors; or to the Tumult which aroſe in the Town-houſe, ſufficiently great to make upon the Doors a Motion ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſhutting of themſelves; or to the Conſpirators, who at that very inſtant they heard the <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> call out to Arms, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd they were betray'd, that their Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy was diſcover'd, that the Archbiſhop of <hi>Piſa</hi> was a Priſoner, and that People were coming to them to ſeiſe upon their Perſons. Thus the Care of their own Preſervation, baniſhing from their Minds the Deſign of making thmſelves Maſters of the Town-Hall, they now thought of nothing but of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53621:102"/>barricadoing, and making a ſtout Defence, till their Companions, who were in the great Church, having maſſacred the two <hi>Medici's,</hi> or thoſe that were to ſecure the Publick Place under the Orders of Chevalier <hi>Pazzi,</hi> could run to diſengage them.</p>
            <p>Not to determine any thing in this Caſe, There they remain'd, coop'd up, till <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> having been taken out of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, where the Prieſts had bound up his Wound, was brought back to his own Houſe, by a great multitude of People, of all the Orders of the City, and principally of the <hi>Mobile.</hi> From thence he caus'd himſelf to be carried to the Town-Houſe, where all the Magiſtrates were immediately conven'd. Not very long was the Deliberation, becauſe the <hi>Medici</hi>'s Friends having had the leiſure to ſend unto all Parts, to inform the Citizens of what occur'd, they had exaggerated <hi>Giuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano</hi>'s Murther, and the Peril with which the Commonweal was threatned, with Terms ſo pathetick, that the whole Town had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Arms, and the Boldeſt had ſeis'd on all Avenues of the Guild Hall, ſetting Guards in the Great Place which was before it. Thus, there was nothing elſe heard from all Parts, than a Confuſion of Voices, which demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a good and ſpeedy Juſtice: And as it was not in the leaſt to be deferr'd, without ſeeing
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53621:103"/>the Great Gate ſhut up by the number of thoſe who offer'd themſelves to ſerve for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners, the Magiſtrates caus'd Ropes to be faſtned to the Bars of the Windows, where the unhappy <hi>Poggio</hi> was the firſt hang'd, and then the other Plotters; who ſeeing on one ſide the Fury of the People ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily animated againſt them, and the Doors broke down by Order of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Magiſtrates, yielded themſelves up on Diſcretion, becauſe they cou'd not do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, at leaſt without killing one another.</p>
            <p>Never Spectacle was ſo hideous, and yet never Spectacle wrought leſs Compaſſion. The Malefactor was ſcarce half ſtrangled, when they cut the Rope for him, to make room for another; the Body fell down, and the People immediately tore it to pieces. Not a Man of them was exempt from the Puniſhment; and all the Favour that was ſhewn to the moſt Illuſtrious among the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices, was to execute them the laſt. <hi>Franceſco Pazzi,</hi> the Author of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, who had wounded himſelf dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly in ſtriking <hi>Giuliano de Medici,</hi> could not get out of the Town, and was fain to hide himſelf in his Uncle's Houſe, where he was diſcover'd by a Maid, and was conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Town-Houſe.</p>
            <p>The Curious obſerv'd, That he ſpoke not
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53621:103"/>ſo much as one word, and there appear'd not any Mark of Reluctance in his Countenance, but onely the Signs of a moſt diſdainful and lofty Fierceneſs. He was hang'd at the Window that is juſt above the great Gate, and there immediately appear'd the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Piſa</hi> to keep him Company. They firſt induc'd him to diſcover the whole Train of the Conſpiracy, and to write it down, and ſign it with his own Hand; which that Prelate was prevail'd with to do, upon a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that the Magiſtrates coming to be mov'd by this Effect of Condeſcendency, would ſhew reſpect to his Character, and abate ſomething of their Severity. Yet he was ſerv'd like the reſt; and whether they had a mind to add a peculiar Infamy to the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment that was common to him with his Accomplices; or, the ardour of the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that executed him was too great to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine what he did; or, in ſhort, that they were glad to put that Affront upon the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> in order to puniſh it at leaſt in that manner, for having been fingering in ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable an Action: This unfortunate Prelate was noos'd up in the Pontifical Robes he chanced to have on. The neareſt Spectators of his Execution obſerv'd, That when he was turn'd off, he faſtned his Teeth in <hi>Pazzi's</hi> Body that hung at the next Bar, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53621:104"/>bit his left Pap with ſo much fury, that the Executioner had much ado to make him let go his hold.</p>
            <p>His Brother, and Couſin-german, who went both by the Name of <hi>Giacopo Salviati,</hi> were truſs'd up by him: but the old Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier <hi>Pazzi,</hi> advancing into the Publick Place, to raiſe and mutiny the People, ſeeing they liſten'd to him no otherwiſe than by way of deriſion, and began already to ſurround him, and pelt him with Stones from off the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes tops, ſpurr'd on his Horſe, that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a vigorous Steed, made his way through, and got happily out through the Gate <hi>della Cruce:</hi> But he retiring towards the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and having no Money about him, was conſtrain'd at two days end to take Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in a Cottage, to get ſome Food, and ſell his Horſe. He was known by the Peaſant he addreſs'd himſelf to; and that Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not altogether ruſtick and dull, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately harbour'd a Deſign upon the Perſon of his Gueſt, for the gaining the Reward which the Magiſtrates had appointed for him that ſhould bring him in. He receiv'd him with great appearance of Humanity, and made him the beſt Chear he could. He perſuaded him to ſtay in the ſame Place, while he went to ſell his Horſe; but in ſtead of performing what he promis'd, he went and diſcover'd
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53621:104"/>him to the Magiſtrates of <hi>Florence,</hi> who ſent immediately to take him up. His Proceſs was perform'd in the wonted Formality: and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ttering himſelf with the ſame Hopes that made the Archbiſhop of <hi>Piſa</hi> reveal all the Secrets of the Conſpiracy, he confirm'd that Prelate's Depoſition, and added thereto the Names of the Accomplices, and the Share that each had had in it. In a word, he did all that Cunning and a baſe Puſilanimity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd him with, to ſave his Life: But when he ſaw that they proceeded, however, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him to the Gallows, and that they ſent him a Prieſt to prepare him for Death, he laid aſide the Maſque, and would not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to any other Sentiments than thoſe which Corrupted Nature ſuggeſts to Mad and Deſperate Perſons. He obſtinately refus'd to die as a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and di'd invoking the Devil. Yet the Magiſtrates were not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſee him buried in a Church in <hi>Florence,</hi> where his Anceſtors had been Interr'd; but the Rabble, whoſe Fury was augmented by the laſt Contempt which the Malefactor ſhew'd to the Holy Sacraments, unearth'd his Body, and threw it in the Layſtall; from whence Juſtice caus'd it to be taken, and ſecretly buried in a Church-yard: But this onely ſerv'd to renew the Tumult; for, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovering the Place where he was, they
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53621:105"/>open'd the Ditch with their Nails, took out his Carcaſs, dragg'd it along the Streets, and after the men were grown weary of disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guring it, they abandon'd it to Children, who threw it into the River <hi>Arno.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Rinato Pazzi,</hi> his Couſin, was no more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, tho' he had a leſs dangerous Commiſſion. He had taken upon him to make the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants of <hi>Mugello</hi> revolt; but thoſe Bumpkins tied him Hand and Foot, brought him to the Town-houſe, where he found his Proceſs made, and the Hangman ready to execute it. Of all the Conſpirators, onely the brave <hi>Monteſecco</hi> had the favour of being put to death after a leſs infamous manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monteſecco,</hi> one of the gallanteſt Men of <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpous'd <hi>Riario</hi>'s Intereſts, and onely out of compliance to him had a hand in the Conſpiracy. He promis'd to Poigniard <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo de Medici</hi> at the Feaſt of <hi>Frejola;</hi> but the Execution having been put off, he fell by chance into Converſation with this <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> and was ſo charm'd with his Perfections, that he refus'd to kill him, under the ſhift, that when he had giv'n his Word, 'twas onely to commit an Homicide, by aſſaſſinating a Man in his Houſe; and not an execrable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, by profaning the Altars with his Blood. His Excuſe was allow'd of, becauſe the young <hi>Pazzi</hi>'s Tutor offer'd his Service to ſupply
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53621:105"/>his Place: And as he was neither in the Great Church, nor in the Town-houſe, he had the better Conveniency of making his Eſcape; but he could not ſo ſoon take Refuge in the State of the Church, but that the Garriſon of <hi>Radicoſano</hi> ſtopp'd him upon the way, and ſent him with a ſtrong Guard to <hi>Florence,</hi> where he had his Head ſtruck off.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seigniore Stefano</hi> and <hi>Antonio de Volterra,</hi> who were to have aſſaſſinated <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> having thus miſs'd their aim, thought it high time to ſlip out of the Church in the beginning of the Fray; and while thoſe who aſſiſted at the Maſs were too much ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifi'd, and too buſie about <hi>Giuliano</hi>'s Body, and <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s Perſon, to mind the Murderers, they ſtole ſoftly to the Door, and made their Eſcape to a Monaſtery, where they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by the Religious, who three days ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd diſcovering them, whether they took pity of them, or would thereby maintain their Convent in the Right of Sanctuary, which they pretended to have obtain'd from Popes and Emperours. But the Magiſtrates order'd a general Search throughout the City, which was perform'd with ſo much exactneſs, that the ſaid <hi>Seigniore Stefano</hi> and his Companion were drawn out of the Place where they thought they were in Safety, and conducted to Puniſhment.</p>
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:53621:106"/>
            <p>All the <hi>Pazzi's</hi> Relations, all their Allies, nay, and all thoſe that had any Engagement with them, were clapp'd up in Priſon, tho' there was not any Proof againſt them; and <hi>Guglielmo de Pazzi</hi> was confin'd for all his Life long to a Village, notwithſtanding he had marri'd <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi>'s Siſter, and that this Virtuous Lady had thrown her ſelf at her Brother's and the Magiſtrates Feet, to obtain, that her Husband might remain free, ſince he had been wholly clear'd by all the Depoſitions of the Accomplices. This was ſomewhat an extraordinary thing, that in ſo great a number of Conſpirators, there was but one that could get out of the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Florence,</hi> without being ſeis'd; and this very Perſon that eſcap'd, was the moſt culpable of all.</p>
            <p>It's well enough known, that I mean <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dini.</hi> This Aſſaſſinate had not been ſo very much blinded with the Promiſes of Impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherewith <hi>Riario</hi> had ſoothed his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices, as not to provide for the Security of his Perſon in caſe of neceſſity. He had borrow'd from his Friends, and from thoſe who engag'd him in the Conſpiracy, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sums, which he put into <hi>Venetian</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Hands, for the receiving them in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> ſix Months afterwards. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, his Man waited for him near the Great
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53621:106"/>Church, with a Horſe of Value; and ſome <hi>Banditti's</hi> of his Acquaintance were walking in the Porch, to make him way, and favour his Eſcape.</p>
            <p>With theſe Precautions, he alone did more than all the other Conſpirators together: He firſt boar'd <hi>Giuliano de Medici</hi> with a Poigniard, thruſt under the Left Pap; and ſeeing that <hi>Pazzi</hi> ſtood obſtinately giving him an hundred Stabs when dead, he left him to enjoy ſo ridiculous a Revenge, and turning towards <hi>Nori, Giuliano</hi>'s Domeſtick, he plung'd his Dagger into his ſmall Guts; then turn'd his Eyes towards <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> in the very moment he was ſaving himſelf in the Veſtry, all wounded as he was. After ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rid his Hands of thoſe two Murders, he ran likewiſe to diſpatch him, and had got up ſo near him, that he would have effected his Purpoſe, but for the Addreſs of an Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, who repulſing <hi>Bandini</hi> with his Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier-Staff, while <hi>Lorenzo</hi> entred, after having ſhut the Door with ſo much precipitation, that <hi>Bandini</hi> had not the leiſure to put his Foot within, ſoon enough to hinder it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lorenzo</hi> having thus avoided Death, <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dini</hi> ſtole ſlily away to the Church-door, from whence, by favour of thoſe who wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him there, he reach'd the Street, and mounting his Horſe, got out of the Gate
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53621:107"/>
               <hi>della Cruce,</hi> and in ſtead of taking the way to the State of the Church, by which he foreſaw they would infallibly purſue him, he fled tow'rds the Sea, where he ran leſs riſque of being known, becauſe the Country was leſs frequented, principally in the State of <hi>Sienna.</hi> And indeed, he got ſafe to <hi>Corneto,</hi> a Port depending on that Republick, where, by a lucky adventure, he found a Ship ready to ſet ſail to the <hi>Levant.</hi> Embarking in this Ship, his Voyage was croſs'd neither by Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats nor by Tempeſt; but he arriv'd at <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata,</hi> where he receiv'd the Money due upon the Bills of Exchange. He pitch'd on that City for his Abode, where he had already al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſetled, when he ſaw himſelf expos'd to the Puniſhment he thought he had avoided.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi>'s Factors diſcover'd him in <hi>Galata,</hi> notwithſtanding all his Care to conceal his Perſon; and as they had Acceſs to <hi>Cady Baſhaw</hi> the Firſt Viſier, they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him, That the Sultan his Maſter was too juſt, to ſuffer any longer in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions the moſt Criminal of Mankind; That it was blaz'd about in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> That his Highneſs had ſhewn an Horrour upon hearing the Circumſtances of the <hi>Pazzi's</hi> Conſpiracy; and that it was not doubted, but he had ſo much Goodneſs, as to refuſe his Protection to a Man who had been its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53621:107"/>Executioner. This Remonſtrance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attended with Preſents capable of affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſelf-intereſſed Perſon, as was the <hi>Grand-Vizier,</hi> had all the Succeſs intended. <hi>Cady Baſhaw</hi> motion'd the Buſineſs to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> at that time <hi>Bajazet</hi> the Second, and made him reſolve not onely to drive <hi>Bandini</hi> out of his Empire, but likewiſe to deliver him up to the <hi>Florentines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was ſaid, That what made him proceed in this manner, was to acquire Reputation among Strangers, and give them a famous Example of the ſingular Virtue he valu'd himſelf upon, which was that of extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating Parricides. They added, That he was willing to lay hold on the Occaſion, to ſhew to all the Earth, how much he honour'd <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi>'s Merit, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready fam'd in the three known Parts of the Univerſe.</p>
            <p>But thoſe who pry'd into the Counſels of the <hi>Divan,</hi> conceiv'd another Opinion of this Reſult. They reckon'd, that <hi>Bajazet</hi> did in this, as in all other weighty Occaſions, follow blindly the Sentiments that were ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to him by his <hi>Prime Vizier.</hi> And that Emperour's Son, <hi>Selim</hi> the Firſt, ſeem'd ſince to confirm this Opinion, when being ask'd, <hi>Why he did not wear a long Beard, like his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> he ſaid, <hi>'Twas for fear the</hi> Baſhaws,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53621:108"/>
               <hi>taking him by it, would lead him where they liſted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was likewiſe more Myſtery in this <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Civility, than appear'd at the firſt Bluſh, to thoſe who made Reflexion upon the two Fleets which the Pope had ſent the Years foregoing againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> They eaſily imagin'd, that <hi>Bajazet</hi> being inform'd of the Secret of <hi>Pazzi</hi>'s Conſpiracy, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other Means then to revenge the Affront he had receiv'd, his Fleet not daring to ſtir out of the Ports where it was, ſo long as that of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> watch'd it); that <hi>Bajazet;</hi> I ſay, had deliver'd up <hi>Bandini,</hi> in hopes, that being put to the Rack, he would depoſe againſt the Soveraign Pontiff, and thus render him contemptible to all <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be it as it will, <hi>Bandini</hi> was put into Irons, and convey'd to <hi>Florence,</hi> where he was hang'd at the ſame Window as <hi>Pazzi</hi> his Companion, tho' long after. However, the <hi>Turks</hi> had not the Satisfaction they expected, of ſeeing the Pope defam'd, becauſe <hi>Bandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi>'s Proceſs was kept ſo ſecret by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, who ſat Judges in the Caſe, that there is not any Light remaining of it.</p>
            <p>After a Period was put to the Executions, and that <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> was cured of his Wound, he caus'd ſtately Obſequies to be perform'd for his Brother <hi>Giuliano,</hi> in the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53621:108"/>midſt whereof there hapned this Adventure. A young Lady, that <hi>Giuliano</hi> had kept, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be his Wife, and declar'd her ſelf with Child by him: Fifty days after was ſhe brought to Bed of a Son, that was mighty like him; and for this Reaſon perhaps it was, that <hi>Lorenzo</hi> caus'd him to be Baptis'd by the Name of <hi>Giulio de Medici,</hi> without explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farther, whether he own'd him for a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard, or for Legitimate. He was brought up with the Cardinal his Couſin-german, and ſucceeded him in the Popedom, by the Name of <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Lorenzo</hi> making a particular Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion on the Misfortune that had befall'n him, found it much greater than at firſt he had imagin'd. He conſider'd it as to its Riſe; and ſeeing that thoſe who had drawn up the Platform of the <hi>Pazzi's</hi> Conſpiracy, might employ againſt him the Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Holy See, he judg'd it became him to make Proviſion againſt them before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, for fear of being oppreſs'd. For this Reaſon it was, that foreſeeing what the <hi>Ria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio's</hi> would do in proceſs of time, by what they had already done, he wou'd before all things bereave them of the Means of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Purpoſes with the Cloke of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, when they levell'd them againſt him. He conjur'd his Friends, as ſoon as ever he
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53621:109"/>had avoided the firſt Fury of the Aſſaſſinates, to take a peculiar Care of the Perſon of the Cardinal-Nephew, and ſent them to diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him, before he ſtirr'd out of the Veſtry.</p>
            <p>They found the young Spark upon the Foot of the Great Altar, in the poſture of a Perſon expecting Death, and was preparing <hi>Chriſtianly</hi> to receive it. The <hi>Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> who were little leſs terrifi'd than the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, had however bethought themſelves to ſorround him, and to make him a Rampart of their own Bodies. Much ado had they to get him thence, becauſe the People, who fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci'd him culpable, already throng'd to tear him piece-meal; and the Magiſtrates were forc'd to ſend their own Guards to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue, and yet would not have been able to have effected it, but by feigning, that their Order was to conduct the Cardinal to the Town-houſe, there to ſuffer the ſame Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment as the other Conſpirators: But they carried him into the ſame Palace where he had lodg'd ſince his Arrival at <hi>Florence.</hi> They ſo carefully watch'd all its Avenues, that his Eminence and his Domeſticks could not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any Inſult, during ſeven or eight days, which the <hi>Florentines</hi> paſt in an horrible agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi>'s Precaution did not end with doing the Cardinal-Nephew important
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53621:109"/>Offices in what regarded his Perſon; but he likewiſe ſav'd his Reputation, in a Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture when it ſeem'd impoſſible to exempt it from Tarniſh. He ſuppreſs'd all the Charges and Informations that concern'd him and his Brother <hi>Riario.</hi> He favour'd the Rumour which was ſpread about, That his young Eminency was wholly ignorant of the Plot. He drew up a kind of Declaration from the Accomplices, authoriz'd by the Council of Eight, who had inſtructed their Proceſs. In a word, he ſent to make him from time to time very humble Excuſes, for that he was barr'd of his Liberty, during the Tumult; and went to pay him a Viſit, as ſoon as all was calm and huſh again in <hi>Florence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for what regarded the Pope, <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> writ to his Holineſs in Terms alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether reſpectful. He crav'd the Republicks and his own Pardon, for the Diſcontents the Cardinal-Nephew receiv'd on his account. He juſtified himſelf, tho' no body accus'd him. He deſir'd, that the Memory of it might be aboliſh'd, and mention'd not in the Letters either his own Wound, or his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Blood, for fear he might ſeem to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Reſentment. In a word, he courted <hi>Riario</hi>'s Friendſhip, by a ſtroke of Politick Prudence, not then in uſe. He made all the Paces for it, and made them with an Air that
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53621:110"/>ſhew'd neither Fear nor Diſtruſt. He ſtaid the <hi>Orſini's,</hi> upon the point of their departing to go and deſolate the Principality of <hi>Forli.</hi> He took upon him to mediate between them a ſolid Reconciliation. He aſſur'd him, that the <hi>Florentines</hi> would no longer concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Conſervation of the Petty So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns of <hi>Romagna,</hi> when the Pope ſhould have a mind to ruine them. And for the utmoſt Mark of Confidence, he offer'd to go to <hi>Rome</hi> upon his Holineſſes Parole, for the labouring by Word of Mouth to deſtroy the dangerous Impreſſions that had been giv'n him to his prejudice, without pretending from him any Boon, or for himſelf, or for his Friends, in conſideration of that Journey.</p>
            <p>However, the Pope had not any regard either to <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s Submiſſion, or to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs wherewith he manag'd the Reputation of the Holy See, and the Honour of the <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ario's,</hi> in ſo nice and Matter. He onely view'd the Succeſs of the <hi>Pazzi's</hi> Conſpiracy, on the Side that could animate him moſt againſt a Perſon whom Heav'n had ſo viſibly protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in ſtead of conſidering it on the Side moſt proper to whet his Indignation. He onely ſuffer'd himſelf to be tranſported by the Motions ſuggeſted to him by Spite, for having miſs'd his Aim; and thenceforward onely hearkned to this Chimerical Reaſon,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53621:110"/>namely, That the onely Means to cover the Fault he had committed, was to purſue it to the end. He fanci'd, that his coming to a Reconciliation with <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> would at leaſt be tacitly owning his having had a Hand in the Conſpiracy contriv'd for his Ruine: And that, on the contrary, by declaring War upon him, and attacking him with open Force, he would hide, in ſome manner, the Foxes Skin under that of the Lion, or fill at leaſt Peoples Minds with ſo vaſt an Idea, and ſo capable of poſſeſſing them by a multitude of Events, which the Sword is wont daily to produce, that they would have no lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to think of what had paſs'd afore.</p>
            <p>Upon this Preſuppoſition, the Pope fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the Counſel given him by <hi>Riario,</hi> to levy Troops and not embroil himſelf a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time in an Enterpriſe whoſe Succeſs might prove contrary to his expectation, by Contingencies his Holineſs could not foreſee; he reſolv'd to take his Meaſures ſo well, for the Ruine of <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that had ſo ſignally declar'd in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, ſhou'd be conſtrain'd to abandon him in ſpite of her teeth. This made the Pope ſend the ſhrewdeſt of his Emiſſaries, call'd <hi>Stefano Noirdi,</hi> to the King of <hi>Naples.</hi> And that he might be diſpos'd to practiſe all his Tricks and Artifices, he had a Cardinal's Cap
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53621:111"/>promis'd him, if he effected his Negotiation. He was given in Charge to repreſent to this King, That the Honour of his Crown was too far engag'd in the Deſtruction of the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines,</hi> to leave them at Peace, ſince the Conſpiracy, wherein the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> his Son had tamper'd, was diſcover'd; and to ſuffer that the Lie ſhould reſt with him; That this young Prince being arriv'd upon the Frontiers of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> with a brave Army, it ought to be put into Action, tho' it were onely to prevent its ruining its ſelf in Sloth, and becoming contemptible by an ignomin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Retreat; That it would have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> had not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd ſo ſoon; but that Step being made, there was no means of going back; That the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſeeing him reſolv'd to ſubdue them, would acquieſce perhaps out of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ſubmit to the Deſtiny which then they would look on as inevitable; whereas if he made a Halt, after having menac'd ſo highly, the <hi>Florentines</hi> would harbour an inſupportable Preſumption, and the other Petty Potentates of <hi>Italy,</hi> after their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, would inſenſibly be accuſtom'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the Crown of <hi>Naples,</hi> for which they afore had Deferences little different from Subjection.</p>
            <p>Theſe Reaſons were too feeble to move ſo
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53621:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>old a Prince, and by conſequence ſo near his Death, as was the King of <hi>Naples.</hi> The Blood that thrill'd in his Veins, was too cold, to be fir'd by ſo ſmall a matter: And Fame was no longer a Good he minded the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding, ſince the moſt Conſiderable of his Subjects had aſpers'd it with ſuch bloody publick Reproaches, that it was no longer poſſible to repair it. Thus <hi>Nardi</hi> chang'd his Deſign, as ſoon as he had felt his Pulſe, and pretending to have receiv'd new Orders from <hi>Rome,</hi> demanded Audience, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the Conqueſt of the State of <hi>Florence,</hi> on condition it ſhould be atchiev'd with the Arms of the Holy See, and thoſe of <hi>Naples,</hi> both obeying one and the ſame General; That this General ſhould be the Duke of <hi>Calabria,</hi> and that the War ſhould be carri'd on at the Pope's Charge onely; That <hi>Riario</hi> ſhould be put into poſſeſſion of <hi>Florence</hi> as ſoon as it was taken, but that he ſhould make Oath to the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> and be bound to hold it of him, as a Fief depending on his Crown.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Naples</hi> had no more regard to this ſecond Propoſition, than to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and <hi>Nardi</hi> was upon the point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to <hi>Rome,</hi> without having made any Progreſs in his Purſuits, when an unforeſeen Accident concluded his Negotiation to his
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53621:112"/>Advantage. The <hi>Orſini's,</hi> unable to remain in Peace, ſince they were ſecur'd of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> with their Brother-in-Law, took the Field; and without conſidering ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Prohibitions of ſtirring under any Lure whatever, which they had had from the Pope, or the Protection granted them, and the Stem of <hi>Colonna,</hi> by the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> had laid waſte all the Territories of that Houſe. Their Boldneſs was augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the little Reſiſtance they had met with in their Deſign, and by the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Adventurers flocking from all Parts, to re-inforce their Troops. They had taken the Caſtles by main might, and reduc'd the Fortreſſes to Capitulate, without excepting that of <hi>Palliano.</hi> The <hi>Colonneſi</hi> being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd all they could do was to retire to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> their wonted Aſyle, where their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts engag'd them to become Sollicitors of the Pope's Affairs with the King: For, as they foreſaw, that it would be impoſſible for them to recover their Places, at leaſt without procuring ſuch a Diverſion on the Side of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> as ſhould conſtrain the <hi>Orſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni's</hi> to go to the Succour of their Brother-in-Law, they concerted their Meaſures with <hi>Nardi,</hi> ſet a going in his favour all their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues; they wrought the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> to write to his Father, in Terms which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53621:112"/>that the Reduction of <hi>Florence</hi> ſhould coſt but ſome few days Siege, and that they would oblige themſelves to bring thither their Friends as ſoon as they had recover'd their Lands; and thus reduc'd the King of <hi>Naples</hi> to ſerve as an Implement to the Pope's Revenge, and the <hi>Riario's</hi> Ambition.</p>

            <p>COmmiſſioner <hi>Nardi</hi> had no ſooner adjuſted with the King of <hi>Naples</hi> the Conditions I have mention'd, than the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> declar'd War againſt the Republick of <hi>Florence,</hi> with the Formalities then in uſe; that is to ſay, He ſent to defie her by an Herald, in the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53621:114"/>Name of the Pope, and the King his Father. He preſcrib'd her the time wherein ſhe ſhould prepare for her Defence, and caus'd the Reaſons he had to attack her, to be given her in Writing.</p>
            <p>Theſe Reaſons were all reduc'd to the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Holy See pretended to have receiv'd in the Perſon of the Cardinal-Nephew. The Conſtitutions of Popes were alledg'd, and the Privileges granted at divers times to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred College. It was maintain'd, That the Eccleſiaſtick Purple render'd no leſs Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, nor leſs Inviolable, the Perſons inveſted with it, than the Secular. And they wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from theſe Principles all that the Quirks of Schools was able to ſuggeſt in Paſſionate Divines, for the blackening the Honour of the Republick of <hi>Florence</hi> in general, and of <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> in particular.</p>
            <p>They urg'd, That the <hi>Pazzi's</hi> Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy had been contriv'd onely to oppreſs the Cardinal-Nephew; That the time of his Journey to <hi>Florence</hi> was deſignedly choſen; That the extraordinary Honours that had been done him, were onely to <hi>Will-i'th'-wiſp</hi> him the more eaſily into the Precipice; That they had ſpar'd him in the Feaſt of <hi>Frejola,</hi> for that <hi>Giuliano de Medici</hi> could not be of the Party; and that his ſudden Departure preſſing the Accomplices to haſten the Blow,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53621:114"/>they had made no ſcruple of attempting it in the Choir of the Great Church, and in preſence of the Holy Sacrament; That the Cardinal-Nephew was ſolely indebted for his Life to the Reſolution the Eccleſiaſticks had ſhewn, of expoſing their own, that they might preſerve his, by putting themſelves in a Poſture, wherein each made him a Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of his own Body; That the ſingle Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to which the Aſſaſſinates ſaw they were reduc'd of cutting the Throats of ſo many Perſons, before they medled with that they aim'd at, had hindred them from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding further; That the Cardinal Nephew was not fetch'd from the Church, till the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy of <hi>Florence</hi> did not think it ſeemly to leave him any longer amidſt the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; That he had onely chang'd the Danger, by going out of the Cathedral; That the Guards that attended him, under the Sham of re-encouraging him, had had Order to hinder him from eſcaping, before they had conſulted anew, whether they ſhould attempt again upon his Life; That the Railleries, Upbraidings, Imprecations, he had every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment heard, were as ſo many Teſtimonies of it; and, That, finally, tho' the <hi>Florentines</hi> did determine to ſuffer him to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> 'twas not that they had repented of their deteſtable Project, but onely becauſe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53621:115"/>thoſe who were leſs impetuous than others, had made reflexion, that all <hi>Europe</hi> would take up Arms to revenge this Crime, which would not have had any Example among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> if they ſuffer'd it to be Crown'd with the Death of a Cardinal-Nephew.</p>
            <p>The time the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> had given the <hi>Florentines,</hi> ſerv'd the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to finiſh the Procedures that were to be us'd, before pronouncing the Interdict. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal-Nephew made his Complaint, and the Witneſſes were heard. The <hi>Florentines</hi> were thrice cited, but for Forms ſake onely, it being pretended, their Crime was too no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, to have need of Confrontation. And the Cenſures were thunder'd our, before the Republick had thoughts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her Defence. Her State was given up to Spoil, and the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> nam'd Commiſſioner to execute the Sentence.</p>
            <p>Nothing of all this ſtartled <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> as having expected it, when the Pope rejected his Excuſes. But he had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for all his Prudence, and his Authority in <hi>Florence,</hi> and in the other Cities of its Dependency, to diſpoſe the People to ſuffer the Interdict without murmuring: For this kind of Lightning was ſo dreaded in all Parts of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World, that the being ſtruck with it, was ſufficient to become execrable to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53621:115"/>all the Faithful. They did not trouble their Noddles with conſidering whether it was juſt or no: And Peoples minds were ſo prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd with this Maxim, That the Puniſhments of Hell were inſeparable from the Thunders of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> for what Couſes ſoever they were darted, that Armies of Sixty thouſand good Soldiers had been ſeen to deſert their General in a Night, and whole Nations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt againſt their Soveraigns, by ſo general a Defection, that he had left him neither Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject nor Domeſtick.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Lorenzo</hi> did not make it his Buſineſs to combate the Sentiment of the Vulgar, tho' he wanted not Reaſons, and that the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piteers had paſt their Word to Preach in his favour. He took a ſhorter, and a leſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wilder'd way; and without ſpeaking of the Authority, or of the Juſtice of the Perſon who had thrown the Thunder, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to evade it, by ſhewing, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from a more near, and a leſs reſpectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hand. He rejected all the Fault of the Interdict upon <hi>Riario,</hi> the Pope's Nephew: And communicating to the <hi>Florentines</hi> what there was againſt him in the Informations of the laſt Attempt, he fully convicted him to have been its Author.</p>
            <p>Afterwards he proceeded farther: And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perceiv'd, that the People began to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53621:116"/>he diſcover'd to them all the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities, which ſerv'd to ſhew, that <hi>Riario</hi>'s Deſign had been principally to uſurp the State of <hi>Florence.</hi> He ſpoke of the Enterpriſe of <hi>Tiſerno,</hi> when the Ambition of this Nephew of the Pope had flam'd out the laſt time; of the Reduction of <hi>Spoleto,</hi> where he had ſettled a Garriſon capable of inſpiring Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie to its Neighbours; of the Conqueſt of <hi>Forli,</hi> without having other Right than<note n="*" place="margin">Bienſcance.</note> Conveniency; and of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Purchaſe of <hi>Immola,</hi> which he was forc'd to traverſe by all manner of ways. From theſe four Principles, <hi>Lorenzo</hi> inculcated to the People, That <hi>Riario</hi> had drawn near <hi>Tuſcany</hi> with no other intent, than to become its Maſters. He made them remark, That the <hi>Pazzi's</hi> had not conſpir'd againſt their Country to become its Tyrants, ſeeing they had not taken any Precautions neceſſary for ſuch a Deſign, and that <hi>Riario</hi> had not omitted the leaſt; That he had been at the Charges of the Plot, exacted peculiar Engagements from the Perſons concern'd in't, adminiſtred Oaths to them, given the Principal Orders, and ſent his Nephew to <hi>Florence</hi> to reap the Fruit of it, with which he had flatter'd his Head when he fram'd the Conſpiracy. He added, That the ſaid <hi>Ria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi> having miſs'd his Aim, endeavour'd to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53621:116"/>effect it by Means, that were not the more lawful, tho' they were the leſs diſguis'd; That poſſeſſing, as he did, the Pope's Heart and Ear, it ſhould not be thought ſtrange that he inſpir'd him with Thoughts conformable to his deteſtable Project, or that he abus'd the Authority of the Church; but that he was to be reſiſted with the ſame firmneſs as <hi>Vitelli</hi> had exerted in <hi>Tiferno;</hi> and that if ſuch a Petty Soveraign, who had hardly any other Right over his Country, than that which his Predeceſſors had acquir'd by the Remiſneſs and Deſertion of foregoing Popes, had not been wanting to make a brave Defence againſt the Forces of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he truckl'd; or of re-enti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng upon the firſt Occaſion that was offer'd, tho' he had ſurrender'd the Place upon Capitulation, and had the Money paid him down on the Naib before his Evacuation; the <hi>Florentines,</hi> with much ſtronger Reaſon, ought to fight to the laſt Gaſp, for the Conſervation of a Liberty whereof they had been Peaceable Poſſeſſors for ſo many Ages, and which none had ever grutch'd or grappl'd with them for, before <hi>Riario.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Reaſons being artificially inſinuated among the People, rendred them in a few days capable of the Sentiments which <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo</hi> was willing to inſpire into them. They
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53621:117"/>heard, without being ruffl'd, the Denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Monitories of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and did but rally at the Placarts that were poſted up and down, to excite them to Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They prepar'd for War with far leſs noiſe, and much more regularity, than when attack'd by <hi>Coglione.</hi> And as States the moſt jealous of their Soveraignty, cannot diſpenſe themſelves ſometimes from ceding it almoſt entirely to Particular Perſons, in ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary difficult Juncture, there was a new Magiſtrature created in favour of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo,</hi> which was in nothing different from the Dictatorſhip of the Ancient <hi>Romans.</hi> They render'd him the Arbiter of the Life and Death of his Fellow-Citizens. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him to put what Garriſon he pleas'd into the Towns and Places, and abandon'd to him even the Power which the Republick was wont to reſerve to its own Management in ſuch like Occaſions, which conſiſted in augmenting the old, and laying on new Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
            <p>In this Dignity was it that <hi>Lorenzo</hi> found the Occaſions to diſplay the admirable Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities he poſſeſs'd for Government, and to put in practiſe what he had learn'd moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd upon this Subject. He took the Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in his Hand; but he took it in ſuch manner, as ſhew'd, that he would reſtore it
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53621:117"/>again as ſoon as the Storm was over. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his Independence was on the other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, he was not wanting to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to them the moſt important Affairs, or to cauſe them to be executed according as they had been reſolv'd on by Plurality of Voices. He did not depoſe ſo much as one of the Commiſſioners and Officers he found in Office. He remain'd ſatisfy'd with inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and encouraging them to ſerve uſefully their Country. In a word, he onely reſerv'd to his own performance the Drudgery and Prickles of Abſolute Authority, and left the Roſes to thoſe whoſe <hi>Genius</hi> was more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, or leſs capable of Fatigue.</p>
            <p>He deriv'd from this Conduct two great Advantages. The one, That there needed leſs time to give the ſubaltern Orders, which were executed with much more diligence and expedition by the ancient Magiſtrates, than they would have been by newer, through the poſſeſſion they were in of procuring Obedience. The other was, That <hi>Lorenzo</hi> not being enforc'd to employ in Common Uſes the Choice of his Friends, as he would have been conſtrain'd by a general Change of Officers, he was at liberty to ſend them to the Potentates of <hi>Italy,</hi> who had not yet any Engagement with his Enemies: Which he accordingly ſo ſucceeded in that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53621:118"/>of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genoua,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbini,</hi> the Marquiſſes of <hi>Ferrara</hi> and <hi>Mantoua,</hi> ſign'd a Defenſive League with the <hi>Florentines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſtand deſcribing the particular Tranſactions of that War; for beſides, as they are not worthy of Remark, I am oblig'd to hint by the Bie, That it is the Buſineſs of a Writer of Hiſtory, and not mine. I ſhall onely ſay, That the moſt conſiderable. Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours which the <hi>Florentines</hi> receiv'd, came from <hi>Milan;</hi> and that their other Allies aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted them ſo feebly, that their Army was never in a ſtate to keep the Field. That of the Duke of <hi>Calabria,</hi> compos'd of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick Troops, and of thoſe of <hi>Naples,</hi> invaded the Territory of <hi>Florence,</hi> where they found the Places of Importance too well provided, to be taken by any other means than that of a regular Siege.</p>
            <p>Yet it was not his Opinion to lay any at all; for he was ſo much the leſs aſſur'd of Succeſs, as that the <hi>Florentines</hi> might eaſily, as ſoon as they had ſeen it, draw together the Troops they had diſpers'd in all the other Places, and form of them a Body capable of famiſhing the Beſiegers, by retrenching their Victuals, or introducing into the Place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd ſo great Succours, or ſuch notable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments, as that it would be a madneſs to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53621:118"/>continue the Siege. Moreover, the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was too near at hand, for the forming an Enterpriſe, which, according to all the Maxims of the Military Art, muſt end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Heats began to be troubleſom. And the Pope, who had bound himſelf to be at all the Charges of the War, had not a Fund to maintain it long, becauſe the Revenues of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Patrimony had been diminiſh'd by the Civil Wars between the <hi>Orſini's</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna's;</hi> from whence the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> had reaſon to foreſee, that his Army would infallibly disband, if he engag'd his Soldiers in a long Siege, without having the Means of furniſhing to their Subſiſtence; and that, on the contrary, he might retain them for ſome Months under his Enſigns, by aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning to them the open Country to pillage, and the little Places that were not able to make Defence.</p>
            <p>From thence it came, that the War was onely made, properly ſpeaking, upon the Hinds and Bumpkins, and that nought but Burroughs and Caſtles of Pleaſure were forc'd during the Spring. The Summer ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, caus'd the Troops to return into Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Refreſhment, and produc'd Events capable of burying the Houſe of <hi>Medici</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Ruines of its Country, if <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had not conjur'd down the Tempeſt, in the very
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53621:119"/>moment it was going to pour down upon Both, by a Hit of Prudence, and conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Generoſity, which had not yet had any Example in Antiquity, and will not perhaps be imitated in future Ages.</p>
            <p>That I may be the better underſtood, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it is, that I enquire a little further into Things, tho' it coſt me a Digreſſion, and that I inſinuate ſome Revolutions of the Dukedom of <hi>Milan,</hi> which occaſion'd thoſe I mean to handle. <hi>Franceſco Sforza</hi> ſeis'd on the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> by an Adventure equally Happy and Capricious. He was the Iſſue of the Concubinage of the Famous <hi>Sforza</hi> with a young Maiden of <hi>Cotignola,</hi> and had addicted himſelf to the Profeſſion of Arms, wherein he was born. His Father was drown'd in going to ſuccour the Cities of <hi>Aquila.</hi> The Troops being deſtitute of that Leader, choſe him for their Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, tho' he was at that time but Twenty years of age. The Event juſtify'd their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and young <hi>Sforza</hi> reliev'd the Place, defeated the Beſiegers, won a notable Battel, and through the higheſt Felicity caus'd <hi>Brac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi> to periſh, who had been his Father's Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, and mortal Enemy. This Succeſs rooted his Reputation, and retain'd the old Soldiers under his Diſcipline. He led them to the Service of <hi>Milan's</hi> laſt Duke, of the Family
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53621:119"/>of the <hi>Viſconti's,</hi> and oblig'd by long La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that Prince, who had no Legitimate Children, to give him his Baſtard-Daughter in Marriage. At firſt he deriv'd no other Advantage from this Match, than of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Woman endow'd with all the Graces of her own Sex, and all the Noble Qualities of ours; becauſe his Father-in-Law was of ſo fickle a Humour, that he made every year a Will, by which he inſtituted him Heir of <hi>Milan,</hi> and null'd it as often to make a new one, which left after his Death his Subjects at liberty to chuſe a Soveraign, or to change their Government into a Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>But at laſt, the Duke dying at a time he was govern'd by his Daughter, and <hi>Sforza</hi> being in the ſame Conjuncture at the Head of an Army, which he commanded for the Duke againſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> he led it on to <hi>Milan</hi> with ſo much diligence, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his Competitors, and engag'd the People by this Surpriſe to own him for their Governour. Afterwards, his Valour made him overcome all thoſe who pretended to diſpoſſeſs him, while his Wife got him the Hearts of his new Subjects, by her obliging Humour, and the Charms of her Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But dying of a Dropſie, at a time <hi>Galeazzo</hi> his eldeſt Son was going into <hi>France,</hi> to the Succour of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh, the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53621:120"/>News that young Prince receiv'd of his Death in his croſſing <hi>Auvergne,</hi> conſtrain'd him to turn back immediately, and paſs thorow the Territories of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd Habit. His Mother had caus'd the <hi>Milaneſes</hi> to take the Oath of Allegiance to him: And the firſt Arms which the <hi>Piomon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſes</hi> had experienc'd to their loſs, had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd him ſo great a Name, that none durſt ſhock him afterwards.</p>
            <p>The profound Peace he ſince enjoy'd, had ſo far engag'd him in Luxury and Delights, that his Court was become a <hi>Seraglio;</hi> the Ladies of Quality were perſuaded, that the abandoning their Perſons to their Prince, was the doing nothing contrary to their Honour. But their Husbands were not of the ſame Opinion: And there were thoſe among the Gentlemen of the Duke's Train, who on this ſcore entertain'd the Deſign of aſſaſſinating him, namely, <hi>Andre Lampoguano, Carlo Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conti,</hi> and <hi>Geronimo Olgiati.</hi> Their Pretexts were, That <hi>Lampoguano</hi> had by Inheritance from his Anceſtors a Mannor holding of the Church of <hi>Coſmo,</hi> whereon the Biſhop had entred, and the Duke refus'd to concern himſelf in the Buſineſs. <hi>Viſconti</hi> unable to endure, that the Duke, not content with uſurping the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> over thoſe of his Houſe, had moreover introduc'd Infamy
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53621:120"/>into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>is Family, by debauching his Siſter, and proſtituting her afterwards to his <hi>Gáni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede. Olgiati</hi> ſet <hi>Brutus</hi> for his imitation, at the Sollicitation of <hi>Monte</hi> his Tutor, animated for that the Duke had had him laſh'd and ſtrappado'd, out of revenge for having whipp'd him in his Youth. The Duke was ſtabb'd in St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Church: And his Murderers, in ſtead of receiving the Applauſe they expected from the People, were dragg'd to Execution, after <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> had deliver'd up one of them, who had taken Refuge in the Caverns of the <hi>Apennine.</hi> A Will was found of the Duke's, which left his eldeſt Son under the Guardian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of his Mother, on condition ſhe ſhould follow the Counſels of <hi>Simoneta.</hi> But <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico Sforza</hi>'s Humour, the Child's Uncle, was too ambitious, to let a long Minority ſpin out, without endeavouring to gain by it. He at firſt diſputed the Tutelage; and that not ſucceeding, he durſt pretend, nay, and declare to ſome Perſons, That the Dutchy appertain'd to him, as being born when <hi>Franceſco Sforza</hi> his Father was Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign; whereas his Brother <hi>Galeazzo</hi> popp'd into the World when the ſame <hi>Sforza</hi> was as yet in a private Capacity. This came to the Regents Ears, who was advis'd to ſend away her Brother-in-Law.</p>
            <pb n="162" facs="tcp:53621:121"/>
            <p>He withdrew to <hi>Piſa,</hi> from whence he form'd in <hi>Milan</hi> ſo potent a Faction, that he wrought his Recall in deſpite of his Siſter-in-Law: He expell'd her, inſtated himſelf in the Poſſeſſion of the Guardianſhip, caus'd <hi>Simoneta</hi>'s Head to be ſtruck off, got the Governour of the Caſtle to an Interview upon the Draw-bridge, ſeis'd his Perſon, had a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows ſet up, and a Wax-Candle lighted, with an Oath to have him hang'd, if the Place was not deliver'd up into his Hands, before the Candle was ſpent. The Garriſon being terrified, and touch'd with Compaſſion, open'd the Gates; and <hi>Ludovico Sforza</hi> wanting For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to maintain his Ground in a Station he had newly poſſeſs'd himſelf of by ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Courſes, recall'd the <hi>Milan</hi>-Troops which were gone to the Succour of the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> was little leſs concern'd at this Repeal, than if he had been ſtruck with Thunder. He perfectly knew <hi>Ludovico Sforza</hi>'s <hi>Genius,</hi> and did not doubt but that this Prince had ſuch Deſigns as would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol his giving any Aſſiſtance to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. And as the Republick of <hi>Florence</hi> could not be without it in this Juncture, it was in the moſt inevitable and neareſt Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to which it had been expos'd ſince <hi>Loren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi> had medled in the Government.</p>
            <pb n="163" facs="tcp:53621:121"/>
            <p>Her other Allies of <hi>Mantoua, Ferrara,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbini,</hi> were not in a capacity to relieve her. And as they had ſent her onely Troops, as thinking her capable of making Head againſt the Duke of <hi>Calabria,</hi> it was to be fear'd they would recall them, and make their Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation apart, as ſoon as they ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that <hi>Ludovico Sforza</hi> had ſet them the Example for ſo doing. For, in ſhort, if that Prince cocker'd in his Mind the Deſign of making himſelf Duke, he was too cunning to attempt it, before he had gain'd at leaſt two of the three Powers of <hi>Italy</hi> who might traverſe it, namely, the Pope by his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, the King of <hi>Naples</hi> by his Authority, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> by their Neighbourhood. And indeed, as <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had Emiſſaries in all the Courts of <hi>Italy,</hi> he knew that <hi>Ludovico Sforza</hi> entertain'd a ſecret Agent to diſpoſe King <hi>Ferrand</hi> to give him in Marriage the Princeſs his Daughter, who was to wed the young Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> when he was come to Age.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had reaſon to ſuppoſe, that the Succours of <hi>Milan</hi> would infallibly bilk the <hi>Florentines</hi> in their greateſt need; and that if <hi>Sforza</hi> ſent back Soldiers into <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> it ſhould be no longer as an Ally, but in quality of an Enemy, ſince he would not do it but for the obtaining by that Infidelity the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53621:122"/>Princeſs of <hi>Naples.</hi> However, it was no leſs indubitable, that the Defection of <hi>Sforza</hi> was going to open to the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> in few Months the Gates of <hi>Florence;</hi> for the Citizens of that Town, who had ſhew'd ſo much Courage at firſt, would begin to pant and ſtagger, as ſoon as they perceiv'd that the Match was not equal, and would divide themſelves into as many Factions as there were Perſons of Quality, who wiſh'd a Change in the State, for the bettering their own Condition. Then there would be no longer any Citizen that would hazard his Life, or contribute to the Charges of the War, and <hi>Lorenzo</hi> muſt be reduc'd all alone to ſupport the Burden, from which he was ſo much the more diſſuaded by Prudence, as that he could not do it without ruining himſelf Root and Branch, if, after having pump'd his Credit, and emptied his Purſe by an exceſſive Expence, after having kept on foot whole Armies out of his own Coffers, he ſhould nevertheleſs ſink, and be involv'd under the Ruines of his Country, his Houſe would have no longer a Fund to furniſh to its Recovery from ſuch a Calamity, as it had done in the time of <hi>Coſmo</hi> the Old, nor a Conveniency of taking Refuge in ſome San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, till ſuch time as there was a return of Good-fortune: if he died in the Occaſion,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53621:122"/>he would be accounted raſh in the Judgment of Poſterity; and if he preſerv'd his Life, it would be onely to ſpin it out, and finiſh it in Poverty, and to re-unite in his Perſon the two moſt notable Adverſities which can van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the Patience of a Man of Heart, <hi>viz.</hi> an Infamous Exile, with a Long Beggary.</p>
            <p>Whereas, if he us'd the ſame Policy which ſo well accommodated his Grandfather, and if, like him, he contented himſelf with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding his own Perſon, without conſuming his Eſtate by a needleſs Expence; on the one ſide, no other Inconveniencies could befal him, than thoſe which would be common to him with the other <hi>Florentines;</hi> and on the other, he would have Reſſources for his Houſe, which would be wholly peculiar to it. For, in what part of the World ſoever it ſhould retire, after having been expell'd <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> it would there find a Stock to ſubſiſt on at eaſe, and in ſuch an abundance, as would diſtinguiſh it from others, and make it be ever conſider'd by the <hi>Florentines,</hi> that were under the ſame Misfortune, as alone capable of reſtoring them to their own Country on the firſt favourable Occaſion. If he loſt his Life in Baniſhment, his Wife, being wife and virtuous, would intereſs the <hi>Orſini's</hi> to take care of the Children he ſhould leave under Age, in hopes of partaking with
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53621:123"/>them the Adminiſtration of ſo many Riches; and if he ſurviv'd to the Republick of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> he might retire to <hi>Venice,</hi> and there enjoy the Priviledges of a Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> which his Grandfather had acquir'd him, in expectation that one of thoſe Revolutions, which never fail'd hapning from time to time in <hi>Florence,</hi> ſhould recal him thither with the ſame Advantages he went thence.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations inſpir'd <hi>Lorenzo</hi> with the Deſign of making his Accommodation in time. And tho' it was not impoſſible for him to conclude a particular Treaty, by which another leſs ſcrupulous would have made up his Account, he wiſely judg'd, that it would be neither for his Honour, or Surety, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinge his own Intereſts from off of thoſe of his Country, for two Reaſons. The one, That he it was that had drawn on the Tempeſt, wherewith it was toſs'd and agitated; the other, That in whatever Part Fortune ſhould prepare him a Retreat, he would never find there what he had left at home.</p>
            <p>Wherefore treat he muſt, and comprehend the <hi>Florentines</hi> in the Treaty; but in this conſiſted the greateſt Difficulty, becauſe <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo</hi>'s Policy, how pregnant ſoever in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients, did not ſuggeſt to him any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Means of bringing it about: For, in the firſt place, there was no hopes from an
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53621:123"/>addreſs to the Duke of <hi>Calabria,</hi> who would not be of a Humour to receive a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Peace, becauſe he would look upon it as if it were to raviſh from him the Glory of the Conqueſt of <hi>Florence.</hi> There was much leſs likelihood, in the ſecond place, in courting the Pope; for beſides that he appear'd too much irritated againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick of <hi>Florence</hi> in general, and againſt <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> in particular, to receive any Submiſſion on their Part; he was, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, too much wedded to the Intereſt of his Nephews, to fruſtrate them of a Spoil of which they were almoſt cock-ſuree, after having ſpar'd no Means whatever for the making it fall into their Hands.</p>
            <p>In the third place, there ſeem'd not to be any Remedy on the Side of <hi>Naples:</hi> For tho' King <hi>Ferrand</hi> was leſs prepoſſeſs'd with Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion than the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> his Son, and than the Pope; yet he was ſo cloſely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd by <hi>Nardi,</hi> to whom the Pope had newly ſent a Cardinal's Cap, that there was no room for doubt, but that this Prince would cauſe all Perſons to be clapp'd up, who ſhould come to him on the behalf of the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines,</hi> under pretence, that they were Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with whom he was in War. That if they went about to ſend Deputies to thoſe three Potentates at the ſame time, beſides
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53621:124"/>their expoſing themſelves to all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences I have newly repreſented, without any proſpect of Succeſs, they muſt hazard the Lives of as many Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as there ſhould be appointed to this Commiſſion; and the Republick of <hi>Florence</hi> would render it ſelf ridiculous, by a Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which would onely ſerve to give its Enemies ſolemn Marks of its Puſilanimity.</p>
            <p>Of ſo many Miſchiefs that offer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s Imagination, he choſe the leaſt; which was to go himſelf and negotiate with the King of <hi>Naples:</hi> For tho' he was aſſur'd (as I have already ſaid) of concluding nought, yet there was ſome glimmering of Hope, that the Surpriſe that Prince might be in at ſuch a Sight, would hinder him from treating him at the firſt bluſh with the ſame Severity which he would have us'd tow'rds a bare Deputy; and that afterwards it would not peradventure be impoſſible to ſlacken and mollifie him, if he gave him Audience. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had a tolerable good Opinion of his own Fortune, as well as <hi>Caeſar;</hi> he knew, that Chance does commonly produce the moſt remarkable Events from weak Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings: he knew the <hi>Genius</hi> of King <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand</hi> to be an Enemy of War, and ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all the Propoſals of Peace that turn'd to his Advantage. He had been fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53621:124"/>of the Addreſs which <hi>Nardi</hi> had us'd to wreſt the Inclinations of this Prince, by making him enter into an odious Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Pope; and by conſequence, did not deſpond of breaking it, provided he had the Opportunity of repreſenting to him by Word of Mouth the Infamy of it, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him obſerve, That he had been paum'd upon when he was promis'd to be made <hi>Ruling Lord of Florence,</hi> ſince the thing could not be effected according to the Terms it had been propos'd.</p>
            <p>Upon this Propoſition, <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> through a Reſult of Heroick Prudence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to go throw himſelf into his Enemies Arms, after having concluded a Suſpenſion of Arms for two Months with the Duke of <hi>Calabria.</hi> As he had conceiv'd this deſign with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Participation of his Friends, he made not any of them his leaſt Confident in the Matter. He gave ſecret Orders for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing what he had moſt Precious. He caus'd two Gallies to ride ready in the leaſt-fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented Port there was upon the Coaſt of <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> and caſting his Eyes upon all the <hi>Florentine</hi> Gentlemen he had reaſon to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt, he found out the Means to hinder them from ſtirring during his abſence. He invited their Children to a Match of Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that way-wards where he was to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53621:125"/>and the Invitation he made them was ſo much the more attracting, as that there were no parts of that Country unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with a World of Stags and Wild Boars. Not a Man of them fail'd the Aſſignation; for there was no Danger to be fear'd, (the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi>'s Troops being too far off, and there being no coming for them to the Place of Hunting, without paſſing upon the Lands of the Republicks of <hi>Sienna</hi> and of <hi>Lucca,</hi> which was never practis'd in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Diſcipline then in uſe.)</p>
            <p>The Chace was good and diverting. And <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> after having conducted inſenſibly this young Nobleſs to the two Gallies, told them, with an Air wherein there was not the leaſt glimpſe of Affectation, That he was going to take a Voyage for a few days to <hi>Naples,</hi> upon Affairs of the Republick. Theſe young Perſons ſeeing him alone, and without Train, fancy'd there would be incivility in ſuffering him to depart in that manner, and offer'd to accompany him, without asking him time to inform their Parents, becauſe they ſaw themſelves too much preſs'd, and that they moreover fanſy'd he would not have led them ſo far, without the Permiſſion of their Relations, who had not hinted it to them, that ſo the Voyage might be kept the more ſecret.</p>
            <pb n="171" facs="tcp:53621:125"/>
            <p>Thus <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> had without any Caballing, and without Violence, the Hoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges he wiſh'd for, and was at liberty to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his Mind wholly to what he was going about, becauſe he had now no need to fear any Commotions in his abſence. Nevertheleſs, he oblig'd his new Squadron to write to <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> afore he ſet Sail. And he himſelf wrote to the Magiſtrates a pretty long Letter, whoſe Abridgment it is here of importance to ſet down. At firſt he ask'd their Pardon for two things: The one, For having underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, without their Participation, a Buſineſs of that Conſequence he was going to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate. The other, Of departing <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> without their leave. He alledg'd but one and the ſame Excuſe for theſe two Faults, namely, That the Affair in hand was ſo nice, that it could not, nor ought not to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of, but by the Succeſs. Then he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, in Terms altogether tender, That he had not been able any longer to endure, that his Country ſhould be in danger in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: And as he ow'd it all, he likewiſe hazarded his all for its Deliverance: That he was going directly to <hi>Naples,</hi> with deſign to undeceive King <hi>Ferrand,</hi> and make him ſee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Injuſtice of the League wherein the <hi>Riario's</hi> had engag'd him: That he could not doubt, but that this Prince was his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53621:126"/>Enemy; but that, notwithſtanding, he did not deſpair of making him condeſcend to ſupportable Conditions: That if he effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted this, he ſhould have the Glory of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empting his Country from the Incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the War; and if God did not in this Point ſecond his juſt Intentions, his Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment or his Death would diſcharge him from the Envy that was born him at <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> and Poſterity at leaſt would do him the Juſtice of putting him in the number of thoſe who had ſacrific'd themſelves volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily for their Country.</p>
            <p>This Letter being brought to <hi>Florence,</hi> had the ſame effect in all Peoples Minds, tho' all People were not enclin'd alike. In regard of <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> his Enemies no longer doubted of his Loſs; and his Friends believ'd it ſo certain, that they began to take their Meaſures for the eſtabliſhing themſelves elſewhere. But while the one and other reaſon'd after their own mode upon this Tranſaction, the two Gallies arriv'd at <hi>Naples.</hi> And <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> ſignify'd to King <hi>Ferrand,</hi> That he was come to have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of paying his Reſpects to his Majeſty, and diſcourſing him upon ſome Affairs, that could not be negotiated by an Interpoſer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s Arrival could not be ſo ſecret, but that the News of it was ſpread all over
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53621:126"/>the Town, before the Perſon diſpatch'd to the King could pay his Majeſty the Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he had in Charge. Inſomuch that the <hi>Riario's</hi> Deputy, who was a <hi>Florentine</hi> by Nation, but otherwiſe <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Enemy, and call'd <hi>Reſſalli,</hi> had the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to go to the Palace, and be preſent with the King, when the Gentleman was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd. He had likewiſe the ſatisfaction to hear, that not onely the King gave him no favourable Anſwer, but did not ſo much as ſay to him any thing poſitive, whereon he had reaſon to take Confidence. He was ſo much the more ſpirited to repreſent to this Prince, as ſoon as the Gentleman was gone, That ſince Fortune had now popp'd into his Hands the Means to terminate in a moment the War of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> to his Glory, and the Advantage of his Allies, without running any hazard, there was no queſtion but that he would uſe them with all the Prudence natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to him: That if <hi>Lorenzo</hi> pretended to be come upon the Faith of the Truce then grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Duke of <hi>Calabria,</hi> he would learn, to his coſt, that that Truce onely regarded <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> or at moſt the neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that lay expos'd to the Inconveniences of the War; but not the City of <hi>Naples,</hi> which was an hundred Leagues diſtant thence: That tho' all the Dominions of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53621:127"/>King <hi>Ferrand</hi> had been comprehended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, (which was not however done in any of the Articles) <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had incapacitated himſelf for enjoying the Benefit of it, by neglecting a Formality, ſo univerſally receiv'd in all the Countries of the Earth, that there was reaſon to maintain, that it appertain'd to the Right of Nations: That this Formality conſiſted in making known to Soveraigns the Deſire a Perſon has of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or croſſing their Dominions, or demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Paſſport before the Journey be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken; and that as <hi>Lorenzo</hi> could not be ignorant of this, he ought to be treated as Culpable, for having violated it: That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more was there to do, than two things, in his regard; the one, to rid his Perſon out of the World; and the other, to ſeiſe it: That the former would be the ſhorteſt, and ſafeſt; but, that if his Majeſty could not ſo ſoon reſolve upon that, his Allies hoped from his Prudence and Equity, that he would give his Orders incontinently for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the ſecond.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Naples</hi> made no preciſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Reſſalli:</hi> He onely gave him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, That this Adventure was ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing, that it well merited to be examin'd with more leiſure. And indeed, hardly ever was Prince ſeen more puzzl'd than King <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,</hi>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:53621:127"/>when he fell to deliberate in himſelf upon the manner he ſhould receive <hi>Lorenzo de Medici.</hi> The Cruelty he was naturally prone to, perſuaded him to uſe Violence: And the fair Pretence he had to execute it, egg'd him on the more to gratifie this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. Moreover, he look'd on the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of <hi>Florence</hi> as a Fief which would hold of his Crown, as ſoon as <hi>Lorenzo de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici</hi> ſhould be no more; and the Life of a Private Man did not ſeem to him ſufficiently conſiderable, to ballance ſuch an Advantage. He was engag'd in a War, that might be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with one Blow. He had promis'd the Pope to put his Nephew in poſſeſſion of <hi>Florence.</hi> He knew the violent Humour of that Pontiff. He foreſaw, that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pardon him, if he let ſo fair an Occaſion eſcape of ſatisfying his Ambition and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge: And the Hiſtory of three or four Ages had taught him, that the Popes had taken away and giv'n the Crown of <hi>Naples,</hi> almoſt as often as the Will or the Caprice had whirl'd them ſo to do.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, the Right of Nations, and good Faith, on which <hi>Lorenzo</hi> was come, ſeem'd to be two ſufficient Reaſons to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade his Detention, to whomſoever ſhould have an abhorrence to notorious Crimes. And as the <hi>Genius</hi> of King <hi>Ferrand</hi> was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53621:128"/>irreſolv'd, he felt in his Soul an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary agitation, when he was to come to a Determination. However, it is not doubted, but that he had at length choſen the unjuſt Courſe, if Curioſity had not juſtl'd in to the Succour of what Virtue he had left, to hinder him from violating the Right of Hoſpitality. He remembers, that <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> was bruited the Worthieſt Man in <hi>Europe.</hi> He remembers the Wonders that were blaz'd of him abroad; and comparing them with the Generous Reſolution that had conducted him to <hi>Naples,</hi> he had a grudging to ſee this Heroe, who was both the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Polititian, and the gallanteſt Man living. He was confirm'd in the Deſign, by the faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of gratifying this Deſire of his, without its being in the leaſt known. He had <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo</hi> whiſper'd, That they might confer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, provided their Interview was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd without any Witneſſes. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> not caring in what manner he ſaw the King, ſo he had but time to diſcourſe him, joyfully receiv'd the Propoſal that was made him, nay, and ſuggeſted the Means of having it effected according to his Majeſty's Mind, by offering to be conducted alone, as ſoon as it was Night, to any Place appointed him.</p>
            <p>Thus was the Interview had in the King's Cloſet, where <hi>Lorenzo</hi> having inſinuated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53621:128"/>to the Monarch's good Opinion, by all the ways that Decency allow'd of, diſcours'd him upon the Subject of his Voyage, and made him ſee into the real cauſe of the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> War, which ſo much care had been taken to conceal and maſquerade, ſo as that it might not fall within his ken. He juſtify'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf fully upon all which the <hi>Riario's</hi> had laid to his Charge; and perceiving the King took ſome delight in what he related to him, he ſtagger'd him quite, by declaring to him. That he needed to bring no other Proof of his Innocence, than the Reſolution he had taken, of coming himſelf to acquaint his Majeſty with the true State of the Caſe. He added, That he demanded no other Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Peace, than thoſe his Majeſty ſhould judge reaſonable; and that the <hi>Florentines</hi> would receive, without murmuring, the Law he ſhould vouchſafe to give them, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had the Honour of informing him of the Quarrel, wherein they were engag'd, maugre their Endeavours and Inclinations for Peace.</p>
            <p>As the King of <hi>Naples</hi> was naturally vain, and that Fortune had never afforded him the Occaſions of ſatisfying the Inclination he had for falſe Glory, tho' he had already Raign'd above Thirty years, he ſwallow'd with avidity that now offer'd, of becoming
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53621:129"/>Arbiter of the <hi>Florentines</hi> Deſtiny, and footh'd his Fancy with the Pleaſure he ſhould have in giving the Citizens of <hi>Naples</hi> a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle approaching that of the <hi>Romans,</hi> when <hi>Tiridates,</hi> the King of <hi>Parthia</hi>'s Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, came to demand Peace of <hi>Nero,</hi> for <hi>Armenia.</hi> In this thought, he ſweetned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly, and abated of his Tartneſs, even to the letting <hi>Lorenzo</hi> know, That if he ſent to inform him of his Arrival by the moſt conſiderable Gentlemen that accompany'd him, and to declare to him he was come as a Deputy from the Republick of <hi>Florence,</hi> to negotiate the Peace, under the Sanction of the Truce; this Overture would furniſh him with the Pretext he needed, to give him a Publick Audience, without derogating from the League he had made with the Pope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lorenzo</hi> accepted this Offer ſo much the more willingly, as that at his departure from <hi>Florence</hi> he had provided himſelf with a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Power, and had taken care to bring along with him the <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi>'s onely Son, the fitteſt Man that could be, to repreſent the Perſonage deſir'd by the King of <hi>Naples.</hi> Whereupon he ſent him the next day to that Prince, to make him the Compliment agreed on: And the King of <hi>Naples</hi> took his time to receive him in <hi>Reſſalli</hi>'s Preſence. The <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi>'s Son, call'd <hi>Tomaſo Soderini,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53621:129"/>himſelf admirably well of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and acquainted the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> with much Boldneſs and Confidence, after having paid him the moſt profound Reſpects, That the Republick of <hi>Florence,</hi> in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a Suſpenſion of Arms, which ſhe had concluded for two Months with the Duke of <hi>Calabria,</hi> had rightly judg'd, that this Interval was too ſhort to obſerve all Formalities neceſſary for the Concluſion of a Peace; and that to improve theſe her few ſo precious Moments to her beſt advantage, by juſtling up to the main of the Buſineſs, without loſing time about the Preliminaries, to <hi>Naples</hi> ſhe had ſent <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> the moſt Conſiderable of her Subjects, that he might Perſonally Treat with his Majeſty, upon the Preſuppoſition, That the Pope would not fail to approve of what ſhould be concluded on at <hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Naples,</hi> after having made young <hi>Soderini</hi> withdraw, ask'd <hi>Reſſalli</hi> what his Thoughts were of the Buſineſs. <hi>Reſſalli</hi> made anſwer, That he perſiſted in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> ought to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch'd out of the World, or at leaſt ſecur'd. <hi>But things are no longer in the ſame State</hi> (reply'd the King); <hi>for we thought yeſterday he came of his own motion, and as a Private Perſon; and now we are inform'd he comes in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53621:130"/>the Name of the Commonwealth of</hi> Florence, <hi>and has the Character of</hi> Ambaſſador Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. <hi>But tho' it were ſo</hi> (reply'd <hi>Reſſalli</hi> haſtily) <hi>your Majeſty may pretend Ignorance, till ſuch time as the</hi> Florentines <hi>have inform'd you of it by the Ways in uſe among Soveraign Powers, in matter of Deputation; and in the mean while, you will have ſufficient ground to act againſt</hi> Lorenzo de Medici, <hi>tho' it were onely to puniſh him for having neglected theſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities.</hi> The King of <hi>Naples</hi> rejoyn'd, <hi>When I have practis'd this ſubtle Prank and Cavil, it will not skreen my Honour from Reproach, in having violated the Right of Nations, in ſo ſignal a Conjuncture.</hi> Then he fell to making a long Exaggeration of <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s Merit, and concluded it with letting <hi>Reſſalli</hi> know, That if he fail'd making a favourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s Dignity, that alone would be ſufficient to render his Reign odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Theſe laſt Words utterly diſcompos'd and nonplus'd <hi>Reſſalli</hi>'s Violence. He manifeſtly ſaw the King of <hi>Naples</hi> fully ſet upon giving <hi>Lorenzo</hi> Audience, and was not ignorant of the Conſequences. Nevertheleſs, as there was no poſſibility of preventing it, at leaſt without running the hazard of a Rupture with the King, from which he was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn'd by <hi>Riario</hi> above all things. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53621:130"/>if the King of <hi>Naples</hi> was reſolv'd to diſcourſe him, the more advantageous was it to the Pope and his Nephew, that it were done with their Participation, and in their Deputy's Preſence, than if it was perform'd without their Privity; becauſe that in the firſt Caſe they might find occaſion, perhaps, to prevent its taking effect: And that if it ſucceeded maugre theſe Endeavours, they would be ſtill in a capacity to husband their Intereſts: Whereas, in the ſecond Caſe, the Odds was too great againſt them, and their whole Stake in danger of being loſt, without hopes of Retrieve, ſince the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> after having treated with <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> needed onely to ſend word to the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> to lead back into his own Dominions the Army that acted in <hi>Tuſcany:</hi> For, as that Army depended almoſt on three Regiments of Infantry, the <hi>Florentines</hi> would enjoy Peace nevertheleſs, with almoſt as much Tranquillity, as if they had treated with the Pope, whoſe Weakneſs would be then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to all the World, and tarniſh'd with the utmoſt Affront.</p>
            <p>This mov'd <hi>Reſſalli</hi> to give the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> King to underſtand, That if his Majeſty thought convenient to grant <hi>Lorenzo</hi> Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Pope his Maſter hoped he would have the Goodneſs not to do any thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53621:131"/>to their Union. The King of <hi>Naples</hi> reply'd, That he would neither ſee <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> nor ſpeak to him, but in the Preſence of his Holineſſe's Miniſter, that he might have an irreproachable Evidence to vouch for the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of his Intentions. <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience paſs'd almoſt wholly in Civilities on both ſides. He appear'd as Ambaſſador Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary from the Republick of <hi>Florence,</hi> and ſaid, That his Superiours had ſent him modeſtly to bewail the Misfortune they had had, of incurring the Pope's Indignation, without being guilty of any thing to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge it; That for overplus of Ill Fortune, they had ſeen the Arms of <hi>Naples</hi> joyn with thoſe of the Church, to lay deſolate their Territory; but that theſe Acts of Hoſtility had diminiſh'd nothing of the ancient Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which the Commonwealth of <hi>Florence</hi> had ever had in his Majeſty's Juſtice, becauſe ſhe had ſuppos'd, that ſo wiſe a Prince muſt neceſſarily have been prepoſſeſs'd to her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, to treat her as an Enemy without any Lawful Cauſe; That it was in order to the deſtroying ſo dangerous an Opinion, that he was ſent to implore Peace of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and to declare to him, That the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> were ſo perſuaded of their not having offended him in any manner, that they would ſubmit to all he ſhould pleaſe to decree, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53621:131"/>humbly to beſeech him to be their Mediator with the Pope.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Naples</hi> anſwer'd ſparkiſhly, That the Commonwealth of <hi>Florence</hi> had found the Secret to make his Sword fall out of his Hand, if he himſelf had been onely Intereſſed in the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> War. But, as the Pope was a Party, he could then make no other Return, than that he already gave his Royal Word, to ſacrifice to the Good of the Peace all his Pretenſions, and all the Charges he had been at, and to employ his Offices with his Holineſs, in order to diſpoſe him to an Accommodation.</p>
            <p>This favourable Reception was follow'd two days after with a Private Conference between the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> King and <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> wherein <hi>Lorenzo</hi> fell immediately to the Buſineſs, and unvail'd to this Monarch the true Cauſes of the War, which the <hi>Ria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio's</hi> had ſo craftily let him ſee onely in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe. He ſhew'd him the Informations of <hi>Pazzi</hi>'s Caſe, and the Memoirs written and ſign'd by the Accomplices own Hand. He made appear, that the Conſpiracy had been hatch'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> with Deſign to mount <hi>Ria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi> to the Soveraignty of <hi>Florence.</hi> He mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly inſinuated, That the Care he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to manage the Soveraign Pontiff's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, that of the Cardinal-Nephew, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53621:132"/>Prince <hi>Furli,</hi> in the time they themſelves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted it by the baſeſt of all Crimes, had drawn the Devaſtations executed upon the Territory of <hi>Florence:</hi> But that he hop'd his Majeſty would cauſe them to ceaſe, after he was inform'd of the Truth from his own Eyes. Then he repreſented to him, in a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe that was beyond conteſt, That ſince <hi>Italy</hi> was divided into ſo many different So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignties, 'twas impoſſible to change any one of them, without hazarding the All it made a Part of: That this Harmony depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no leſs of the ſmalleſt Powers, than of the greateſt, becauſe none of them was then ſo weak, but whoſe Aggrandizement it was neceſſary to obſtruct: That thoſe whoſe States were more Conſiderable, for their Riches, or Extent, had more Intereſts than the reſt to maintain the Counterpoiſe; ſince by ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, they would loſe much Advantage: That his Majeſty and the Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> were of that number; but that the Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> was not ſo much concern'd in this Affair: for tho' the Pope had ſeis'd on <hi>Tuſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> he would ſtill have a Refuge left in the Empire, whoſe Feudatory he was: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if the Realm of <hi>Naples</hi> was menac'd, after the Republick of <hi>Florence</hi> her being ſubdu'd, he would be deſtitute of all Means of Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, ſince that Kingdom muſt depend on
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53621:132"/>the ſame Power which would endeavour its Oppreſſion, and none would be concern'd, or interpoſe in its Protection: That his Majeſty muſt needs know, that the Intention of the Popes had ever been to reunite to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſn the Crown of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily:</hi> That <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fourth was not of a Humour to neglect pouching the firſt Occaſion offer'd, ſince his Paces did ſufficiently evince, that he was at watch for ſuch an Opportunity: That the Alliance of the <hi>Riario's</hi> was onely a Trap; and the Promiſe of holding the State of <hi>Florence</hi> in Fief of the Crown of <hi>Naples.</hi> onely an Illuſion; ſince there was no Surety given to keep tack, when the Prince of <hi>Forli</hi> had once got Poſſeſſion. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there was none mention'd in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the League; but tho' there had been, the Performance thereof was unfeaſible and impoſſible; becauſe the Prince <hi>de Forli</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Children, when once dead, the Pope then in being would pretend, that the Fief muſt be reunited to the Eccleſiaſtick State, and not to the Crown of <hi>Naples,</hi> and would clutch it with ſo much the more eaſineſs, as that the Demeſn of <hi>Florence</hi> touch'd on his Lands, and that the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> could not ſend Troops thither without his Permiſſion: That, in fine, the Safety of all <hi>Italy</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and that of his Majeſty in particular,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53621:133"/>conſiſted in impeding Strangers from getting footing amongſt them: But that this their Excluſion was in no wiſe to be effected by continuing the War againſt the <hi>Florentines;</hi> for if the <hi>Florentines</hi> were pinch'd, they'd not fail to accept the Offers of a Puiſſant Succour made them by the moſt Chriſtian King. And beſides, well known it was, that they were ſo enclin'd, that out of deſpair of preſerving their Liberty, they would prefer the <hi>French</hi> Sway, to whom they were united by Commerce, before that of the <hi>Riario's:</hi> That in this Caſe the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> might aſſure it ſelf of being firſt attack'd, becauſe upon it the <hi>French</hi> had the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and moſt legitimate Pretenſions.</p>
            <p>As all theſe Reaſons were invincible, and that the King of <hi>Naples</hi> had not made any Reflexion on them when he Confederated with the Pope, they convinc'd him. And Timidity, which was his ruling Paſſion, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him ſee nearer at hand the diſmal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects wherewith <hi>Lorenzo</hi> threatned him, he made no ſcruple of owning to him the Deſire he had to terminate the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> War, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd of him but two days time to contrive the Means of bringing it about. <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> overjoy'd to ſee ſo happy a Progreſs in his Deſign, return'd to his Lodgings with the ſame Precautions he came thence, that is to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53621:133"/>ſay, without being attended or ſeen by any, and left the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> King to conſult and ruminate with himſelf about the Courſe he was to take; for this old Prince communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated nothing of this Affair to his Miniſters, ſo fearful was he of their being gain'd and Penſion'd by <hi>Riario.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He reſolv'd to ſend for <hi>Reſſalli,</hi> and ſound him, whether it were poſſible to prevail with the Pope to ſlacken in favour of the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines. Reſſalli</hi> at firſt made ſome difficulty to tell his Mind; but being preſs'd at ſuch a rate, as that he was compell'd to ſpeak, or declare by his ſilence that the Pope was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable, he freed himſelf out of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, by propoſing to the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> That his Majeſty would diſpatch a Meſſenger to his Ambaſſador at <hi>Rome,</hi> to acquaint the Pope with <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s Voyage and Propoſals, and to know of his Holineſs after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and on what terms he was willing a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation with him ſhould be ſet on foot. He added, That he would diſpatch at the fame time a Courrier to his Holineſs, to inform him of what occurr'd at <hi>Naples,</hi> and require his Directions; and that after he had receiv'd them, he would not fail to communicate them to his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Naples</hi> accepted this Offer, becauſe it tended to his receiving at the ſame
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53621:134"/>time a double Illuſtration of what he had ſo much a deſire to know. But the Pope, who did not curb his Humour in things wherein he believ'd Diſſimulation was not abſolutely neceſſary, anſwer'd the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> King's Ambaſſador, and ſent Orders to his <hi>Nuncio,</hi> not to liſten to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> till they talk'd of yielding at Diſcretion. He utter'd his Mind in this manner with ſo much the leſs ſcruple, in that he did not as then the leaſt imagine that the King of <hi>Naples</hi> was capable of leaving him in the lurch; and that being much better inform'd than that Prince, of the Extremity the <hi>Florentines</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to, he foreſaw, that there needed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two or three Weeks delay, to oblige them to crave Mercy.</p>
            <p>However, he was miſtaken in his Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; and his Holineſs's ſturdy Anſwer ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fully convinc'd the King of <hi>Naples</hi> of all <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> had told him, that old Prince could no longer reſiſt the Temptation of abandoning the Pope, and harbour'd no other Thoughts, than of making his Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation apart. Not but that he ſaw well enough all the Conſequences of the thing; but he had ſuch an urging to conclude it, that he found out in the ſame Inſtant Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the Inconveniencies, furniſh'd by his Imagination being craz'd and wounded with
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53621:134"/>Fear. Thus he thought of nothing now, but of haſtning his Deſign; and in the very next Audience he gave <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> he agreed with him not onely a Treaty of Peace, but likewiſe an Offenſive and Defenſive League, for Ten years, between the Crown of <hi>Naples</hi> and the Commonwealth of <hi>Florence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſo amaz'd the Pope, that he would neither believe what <hi>Reſſalli</hi> wrote to him, nor what was own'd to him by Baron <hi>Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſano,</hi> the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Ambaſſadour at <hi>Rome:</hi> Nor was he to be undeceiv'd, till the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> had reſtor'd the Places he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and brought home the Army he commanded into his Father's Dominions. Then, as domineering Paſſions have this Property common to great Rivers, which overflow with ſo much the more Rapidity, as that the Banks which held them in were ſtronger, or the more Care or Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice us'd to withſtand them; the Pope fell into ſuch an Indignation, as could not have more dangerous Symptoms. He exclaim'd againſt his Ally, and againſt his Enemies, at the ſame rate with thoſe who mean no longer to keep any meaſure in their Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He was not content with interdict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Florentines,</hi> he excommunicated them all in general, and <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. He abandon'd their Republick to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53621:135"/>whoever had a Mind to poſſeſs it. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to whet the Ambition of the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> by propoſing to them ſo rich a Booty; and ſeeing they were pall'd by the Difficulties of ſeiſing it, which ſeem'd to them invincible, he ſollicited Foreign Powers, and fell to minding the <hi>Germans</hi> of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Pretenſions upon <hi>Tuſcany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> true it is, he was not excommunicated, nor his Realm interdicted; for there was neither Reaſon nor Pretext ſufficient to come to that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. But bating this, a ſtop was put to all the Graces the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> were wont to receive from the Holy See. They were barr'd all hope of any in the future. And as it was known, that the Nobleſs of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were reduc'd to their Obedience to King <hi>Ferrand,</hi> meerly by the Menaces of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench'd from the Communion of the Church, they were ſollicited to revolt, under the Lure of Impunity; and a beginning was made to cavil the Inveſtiture of <hi>Naples,</hi> which the foregoing Popes had granted to the Houſe of <hi>Arragon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as the Pope's Humour was nice in matter of Hatred, the Averſion he had for <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> proceeded from a Motive ſo much the more difficult to ceaſe, as it was the leſs known by thoſe who might inter-meddle
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53621:135"/>in the Reconciliation: For tho' this Pontiff had much ado to digeſt, that <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had hindred him from exalting his Houſe to the Soveraignty of <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> tho' the ſame <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had in hand Matters ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict him of the baſeſt and blackeſt of Crimes, and had ſhewn the Originals of them to the King of <hi>Naples;</hi> tho' he had ſpirited this Prince from his Alliance, and had made the Troops of the Church receive the moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Affront, by expoſing them to a ſhameful Retreat, after the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi>'s Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet all this was not preciſely what lay heavieſt at the Pope's Heart. He was more ingenious to torment himſelf, than were his very Enemies; and laying aſide the Intereſt of his Grandeur and Reputation, he could not endure that <hi>Lorenzo</hi> (after having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair'd of ſaving his Republick by continuing the War) had choſe rather to go throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the Arms of the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> than into his; and making the due Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon he might well in this Occaſion, he pois'd the Holineſs of the Head of the Church, and his Quality of Common Father of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> with the King of <hi>Naples</hi>'s Character, who was reckon'd in <hi>Europe</hi> for the moſt Cruel, the moſt Perfidious, and the moſt Self-intereſſed of all Princes. He from thence concluded, That <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> muſt
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53621:136"/>needs have imagin'd, that this King (as Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as he was) was ſtill better than his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſince he had preferr'd him before him in the niceſt Choice that can be made in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Life, by confiding in him both his Life and his Fortune. Thus the Pope would have omitted nothing of what he judg'd proper to puſh on his Reſentment, had not the <hi>Turks</hi> at that time ſeis'd on the City of <hi>Otranto,</hi> and put therein Troops they had aſſembled in <hi>Epirus.</hi> So ſudden an Invaſion was more efficacious, than had been all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Humane Conſiderations. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united the Princes of <hi>Italy;</hi> it reconcil'd <hi>Lorenzo</hi> with the Pope; it caus'd the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to be taken off that were fulminated againſt the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and the Pope rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtated them in the Communion of the Church, on condition they would ſend Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Gallies to block up the Port of <hi>Otranto</hi> and maintain them there at their own Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as long as the Siege ſhould laſt before that Place.</p>

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53621:136"/>were inform'd of the Death of their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Second, as if they had deſponded of their Good-fortune under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Head. The Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> having no more Common Enemies, fell to ſparring with one another: And the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> hearing of the Death of <hi>Borſo da Eſté</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> imagin'd it would be eaſie for them to ſeiſe on his Territory, becauſe <hi>Hercule da Eſté</hi> his Succeſſor was too young, and too voluptuous to ſupport the Fatigues of the War. But as it was hardly poſſible to give a ſpecious Colour to that Uſurpation, without hooking in the Pope, the Senate had him pump'd by their Emiſſaries, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to him the ſharing that Marquiſate with the Republick, after it was conquer'd at their mutual Charges. The Pope em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd the Propoſition, becauſe that (well perceiving his Death was near at hand) he would make as much haſte as he could to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandize his Nephews. Thus the League was concluded, and the new Marquis attack'd by his two Neighbours, when he onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them Compliments of Condo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance upon his Father's Death. The firſt thought he had, while a putting himſelf in a Defenſive Poſture, was to have recourſe to <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> who was become ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in <hi>Florence,</hi> by the late Service he had

The Marquis caus'd an Envoy extraordinary to repreſent to him the Injuſtice that was done him, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſequences of the War newly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> who had already foreſeen thoſe Conſequences, was not ſatisfy'd with aſſiſting him with the Succours of <hi>Florence,</hi> but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over wrought him a Counter-League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino,</hi> and the Republick of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> for the Conſervation of the Land of <hi>Ferrara.</hi> Thus, in a little time after, four Armies appear'd in the Field, whoſe Succeſs was pretty well balanc'd: That of <hi>Venice,</hi> under <hi>Roberto da San Severino,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it ſince <hi>Coglione</hi>'s Death, and who nicking the unexpected Death of the Duke <hi>d' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino,</hi> General of the Troops appointed for the Guard of the Dutchy of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated them without hazarding a general Battel, and came pouring on Victorious to the Gates of <hi>Ferrara.</hi> But, on the other ſide, the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> having advanc'd too far into the Eccleſiaſtick State, with the reſt of the Confederated Troops, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated at <hi>Velitre,</hi> by <hi>Roberto Malateſta,</hi> Lord of <hi>Rimino,</hi> General of the Pope's Army. The
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53621:138"/>Principal Lords of <hi>Naples</hi> were ſlain or taken Priſoners in this Action: And the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was already preparing to march to the Conqueſt of that Kingdom, when <hi>Riario,</hi> far from ſuffering him to have ſtill that Occaſion of becoming more Famous and Recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, having reſolv'd to diſpatch him, three days after the Battel had him poyſon'd, of which he died in two hours time. Then <hi>Riario</hi> was contriving to put into <hi>Rimino</hi> ſuch Soldiers as in whom he might confide: But <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> having notice of his Intention by his Spies, caus'd other Troops to ſlip into it, that ſecur'd the Place for <hi>Malafeſta</hi>'s Heirs.</p>
            <p>This Precaution, however, mended little the Affairs of the better Party; for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of <hi>Venice</hi> being become Miſtriſs of the Campagn, after the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, and the Duke of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino</hi>'s Death, block'd up ſo cloſely the City of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> that <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo</hi> judg'd they would infallibly take it, if he had not recourſe to the onely Remedy to ſave it. This Remedy conſiſted in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the Pope's Alliance with the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> And to accompliſh this Deſign, there was no other way, than to threaten his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs with a Council. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> made the Propoſal of it to the Emperour, and to the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> who back'd
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53621:139"/>this Overture with ſo much heat, that the Council neceſſary to unhinge his Holineſs was Conven'd.</p>
            <p>The News his Holineſs receiv'd of it, ſtartled him no leſs than if he had already felt the Blow. He remembred the Trouble that another Council, aſſembled at the ſame Place, had put one of his Predeceſſors to; and as he did not expect to be ſo fortunate as that Pope, in parrying the ill Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that he ſaw not the ſame Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Peoples Minds that Holineſs had met with to divide them, he fanſy'd he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be depos'd from the Papacy, if he did not ſuddenly remove the Scandal of the War of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and do with a good Grace what was deſir'd of him by all the Chriſtian World. From thence it came, that he was not contented with abandoning the <hi>Venetian</hi> Commonwealth, without alledging any cauſe for his Deſertion; but moreover he let her know it by a Publick Declaration, as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable at leaſt as a Declaration of War. He cited her before his Tribunal, to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Acts of Hoſtility ſhe had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Dutchy of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and of the Pretenſions ſhe might have upon it. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her to reſtore what ſhe had there taken, and command thence her Troops; in default of which, he proteſted he would go
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53621:139"/>joyn the Confederated Princes, to conſtrain her to it.</p>
            <p>The Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> ſhew'd more firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than was expected from a Republick ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd to venture her ſelf the leaſt ſhe could with Fortune. They did not trifle away their time, with vainly reproaching the Pope with his Breach of Faith, nor with putting him in mind, that he it was that had engag'd them in the Quarrel, which he would now hinder them from deciding. They affected in that reſpect a kind of Inſenſibility, which might paſs for a juſt Contempt, and anſwer'd with a Haughtineſs mingl'd with Reſpect, That not owning any Superiour Power upon Earth, they were not bound to give any one an Account of their Actions, nor to deport themſelves at anothers Pleaſure, in a War they had thought juſt when they undertook it.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Venetians</hi> Stubbornneſs and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, of neceſſity drawing after it a long and difficult War, having oblig'd the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> to meet at <hi>Cremona,</hi> ſo to reſolve among themſelves what Courſe was to be taken, <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> appear'd there in Quality of Ambaſſador from his Republick, and comported himſelf in ſuch manner, as finiſh'd giving to his Reputation the livelieſt Luſtre of which it was capable; for tho' his
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53621:140"/>paſt Actions, and principally his Voyage to <hi>Naples,</hi> had proclaim'd him the greateſt Stateſman then in <hi>Italy,</hi> there was, however, ſome room for doubt, whether he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood War ſo well as Negotiation. And the extreme Care he had ever had to appeaſe Quarrels as ſoon as they begun, ſeem'd to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Conjectures of ſome Perſons, that he had a diffidence of his Military Virtue, and not ſo good an Opinion of himſelf, as to think he was capable of executing in the Field, what he had concluded at the Board. But in the Aſſembly of <hi>Cremona</hi> he talk'd of War with ſo much ſufficiency and eaſineſs, that the whole Congreſs went thence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded; that he was no leſs fit for Arms, than polite Letters; and that he had an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble knack at inſpiring vigorous Reſolutions, when he judg'd them neceſſary for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Good.</p>
            <p>He repreſented to this Congreſs, That <hi>Italy</hi> had not then any more formidable Enemies than the <hi>Venetians;</hi> That they had alter'd the Deſign of being wakeful for the Publick Liberty, which they had ſo happily proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted during ſo many Ages, into the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ſubduing it; and that the War of <hi>Ferrara</hi> was an evident Proof of this Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: That the Good and Well-meaning might with conveniency ſuffer them to come
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53621:140"/>out of their Marſhes, and take footing on the <hi>Terra firma,</hi> while they concern'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no farther than to exterminate the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants of <hi>Padoua,</hi> and againſt the Emperours to protect the Holy See; but that in the preſent Juncture they could not with Juſtice approve of their Enterpriſes, ſeeing they tended to the Oppreſſion of <hi>Italy:</hi> That they had almoſt reduc'd to Extremity the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant City of <hi>Ferrara;</hi> and that if they were ſuffer'd to preſs it, there would be no means left to hinder them from rendring themſelves afterwards Maſters of <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Reggio:</hi> That they would find in thoſe two Cities the Keys of all the Places of <hi>Romagna,</hi> ſuch Conveniencies would they afford them, for the ſeiſing them in the ſame time they ſtripp'd the right Owners of the Means of making their Defence; and that after the Conqueſt of <hi>Romagna,</hi> the moſt Potent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Italy</hi> would have no longer any League of Communication, and might be eaſily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued one after the other, by a Republick whoſe Counſel being Eternal, and ever Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, would ſtill keep her in a poſture of nicking the Revolutions which Time and Fortune ſhould introduce among her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi>'s Diſcourſe made all <hi>Italy</hi> take up Arms againſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53621:141"/>them quickly to ſhift the Deſign of Uſurping others Dominions, into that of defending their own. <hi>Hercule da Eſté,</hi> at the Head of a formidable Army, entred the Territory of <hi>Breſcia</hi> and <hi>Bergamo,</hi> and forc'd (by this Irruption) the <hi>Venetians</hi> to recall the Troops which had almoſt reduc'd <hi>Ferrara</hi> to Extremity. Thoſe Troops diſpers'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after ſome Skirmiſhes, wherein they had the diſadvantage; and all the Champion of the <hi>Terra-firma</hi> was ſo abſolutely deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that not a <hi>Venetian</hi> Soldier now appear'd, to hinder the Pillage; when the Senate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd a way to divert the Storm, by which they were upon the point of being wreck'd, by a Device whoſe Succeſs was anſwerable to their Expectations.</p>
            <p>They had perceiv'd, that <hi>Ludovico Sforza,</hi> who govern'd then the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> in Quality of the Duke his Nephew's Guardian, had engag'd in the League rather for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies ſake, than of ſet Deſign; becauſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving whirl'd his Head with uſurping the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, of which he had onely the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, it was no longer for his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that the Confederated Princes ſhould weaken the <hi>Venetians,</hi> for fear they ſhould turn afterwards againſt him. In this view, they diſpatch'd from <hi>Venice</hi> a ſly and experienc'd Senator. He wriggl'd himſelf
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53621:141"/>into <hi>Ludovico</hi>'s good Opinion, by making him obſerve, That he unwittingly contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Execution of others Affairs, by ruining his own; and that the Counter-clap of the Miſchief he did the <hi>Venetians,</hi> if he had not a care, would recoil ſuddenly upon himſelf; Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> he was engag'd in a League which could not but be prejudicial to him, ſince whoever pounc'd the State of the <hi>Terra-firma,</hi> would render himſelf Maſter of the Land of <hi>Milan</hi> when he pleas'd; That young <hi>Hercule da Eſté,</hi> to whom that Conqueſt was deſign'd, had Ambition; and that when he was become extraordinary Potent, ev'n beyond his Deſires and Expectations, he would ſtill drive at more, and endeavour to bring about his Aims; That the true Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> was to hinder <hi>Italy</hi> from changing Maſters, becauſe while it continu'd in the ſame State, that Dutchy would ever be a principal Part of it, and its Maſters, by conſequence, always the moſt Conſider'd Princes of <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Ratiocination was ſo much the more agreeable to <hi>Ludovico Sforza,</hi> in that it was conformable to his <hi>Genius.</hi> This Prince, too refin'd in all things, ſuffer'd his Temper to be cajoll'd with the Vanity of ſhewing his Power, by obſtructing the Accompliſhment of an Enterpriſe ſo near an iſſue, as was that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53621:142"/>of ruining the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and in drawing from the Brink of the Precipice the moſt Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Republick in the Univerſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing ought elſe than ſuſpending his Concourſe, and forbearing to act in Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with thoſe who were going to puſh on its Downfall. He abandon'd the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, without giving them notice. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a ſecret Treaty with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> without foreſeeing, that this ſame Treaty would be the Cauſe of his own Ruine, and of that of his Family. He recall'd his Troops from <hi>Hercule da Eſté</hi>'s Army, which made up the better part of it, and reduc'd him, by this Deſertion, to depart <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into his own State. And thus the War ceas'd, in the ſame manner as a Fire that is retrench'd of Fewel; and the Pope conceiv'd ſuch a Vexation at it, as augmented the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, whereof he died the Tenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1484.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> after having endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to make know to <hi>Ludovico Sforza</hi> the Fault he committed, propos'd to the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> to employ the Soldiers they had in the Confederated Army, in recovering the City of <hi>Serezana,</hi> which <hi>Fregoſo</hi> had taken from them, and ſold to the Republick of <hi>Genoua.</hi> The Council of Eight gave their Aſſent to this Expedition. The Town was beſieg'd,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53621:142"/>and made ſuch a vigorous Defence, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s appearing at the Siege. His Preſence cool'd the Courage of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and of the Garriſon: They ſent to preſent him with a Crown of Olive, and the Town ſubmitted to the Laws he thought fitting to impoſe on it. She open'd to him her Gates, and receiv'd him with the ſame Serenity, as if ſhe had no cauſe for Fear and Apprehenſion. This Teſtimony of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him, was not uſeleſs to her: And if <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> did not treat her alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as Innocent, he hinder'd at leaſt her being ſentenc'd to a Redemption from Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and from being robb'd of her Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges.</p>
            <p>At his Return from this Expedition, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune furniſh'd him with the Occaſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paying with Uſury the King of <hi>Naples</hi> the good Office he had receiv'd. The City of <hi>Aquila</hi> was now revolted againſt this Old Prince, whoſe too great Severity was ever gravelling him in new Troubles, and had put it ſelf under the Protection of the Holy See. <hi>Innocent</hi> the Eighth, ſucceeding <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fourth, had granted her this Protection with too much precipitation, and without examining the Conſequences it might have. The <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Nobility, who onely waited for the Pope's Declaration to have a Pretence
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53621:143"/>for Rebellion, took the Field, and cauſing al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Cities to revolt where they had Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, reduc'd their King to the neceſſity o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> remaining pent up in his Capital City. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berto da San Severino</hi> being malecontent, as well as the reſt, accepted the Generalſhip of the Pope's Armies, tho' his Brother of the ſame Name had been poyſon'd in that Poſt, and ſpirited away the Troops which the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> was leading from <hi>Taranto</hi> to his Father's Succour.</p>
            <p>So many redoubl'd Misfortunes did ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> that he did not ſo much as think of demanding Succours of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo;</hi> when <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> through an exceſs of Generoſity, hazarded ſo many things to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue and diſengage him out of ſo great a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril. And indeed, without having receiv'd either Letters or Courrier from <hi>Naples,</hi> he had already put the <hi>Orſini's</hi> his Allies into the Field, and had giv'n them Money to raiſe Troops. He had likewiſe caus'd Sums to be diſtributed to <hi>Proſper</hi> and <hi>Fabricio,</hi> Heads of the Houſe of <hi>Colonna,</hi> to the very Concurrence ſtipulated in the ſecret Treaty, which that Houſe had concluded with the Crown of <hi>Naples,</hi> for their mutual Defence againſt the Holy See. And theſe two Clanns, forgetting for a time their Quarrels, acted in Conjunction, and caus'd part of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53621:143"/>State to riſe. This forc'd the Pope to recall <hi>San Severino,</hi> who made notable Progreſſes in <hi>Abruſſia. San Severino</hi> was not ſo happy in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Patrimony, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd himſelf ſo ſorrily againſt the <hi>Orſini's</hi> and the <hi>Colonneſi,</hi> that the Pope, whoſe Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour was diſtruſtful, ſuſpected him of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with his Enemies. And this pretended Colluſion gave him occaſion to fear, that the two Armies (after having ſpent ſome time in making ſemblance of fighting) would joyn, and march againſt <hi>Rome</hi> with Enſigns diſplay'd.</p>
            <p>His Holineſſes Warlike Temper was chill'd of a ſudden: He courted Peace with Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation, as he had with Levity declar'd War; and choſe rather to addreſs himſelf to <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> for the negotiating it, than to any other, it being in his Power ſooner to conclude it, and without obſerving the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Formalities.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Lorenzo</hi> was the Arbiter of <hi>Italy,</hi> and perform'd this glorious Commiſſion with ſo much Addreſs, that he merited the Pope's Amity, without abating the leaſt of the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> King's Intereſts: For this Pontiff having on one ſide acknowledg'd the Fault he had unſeaſonably committed; and on the other, <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s Moderation not ſuffering that the King of <hi>Naples</hi> ſhould derive
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53621:144"/>any other advantage from the riſing and lowring Commotions of the Eccleſiaſtick State, than that of Conquering what lawfully appertain'd to him; His Holineſs was ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with this Heroe's Virtue, that he ſince rais'd the Houſe of <hi>Medici</hi> to the Soveraignty we now ſee it ſtand poſſeſs'd of.</p>
            <p>The Pope had been marry'd in his Youth, and the eldeſt of his Children, call'd <hi>Abe,</hi> was to be Head of that Illuſtrious Houſe, and Heir of that of <hi>Maleſpina,</hi> which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd two Principalities, and other fair Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories in <hi>Italy. Lorenzo de Medici</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd to give him in Marriage <hi>Margarita</hi> his eldeſt Daughter, and the Nuptials were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with ſuch Magnificence as held no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Private Life. Afterwards the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Cardinals was aſſembled to ratifie the Intention the Pope had of making <hi>Giovanni de Medici, Lorenzo</hi>'s youngeſt Son, Cardinal, tho' he had not yet accompliſh'd his Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of age. The thing was diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, in that ſince <hi>John</hi> the Twelfth's Papacy, and the Calamities with which it was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all the Soveraign Pontiffs that ſucceeded him, to the number of above Fifty, had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd for inviolable Laws, That thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward no Perſon ſhould be admitted into the Sacred College, before his Majority. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Suffrages of the Cardinals were ſo
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53621:144"/>carefully hook'd in, and they were inſpir'd with ſo auſpicious a Deſire to ſlacken in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Pope, who had not neglected to ſollicit them in private, one after another; and in conſideration of <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> who had newly freed them from a War, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which all their Revenues had been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred; that at length they conſented to what was required of them, on Condition it ſhould be by way of Diſpenſation onely, and without turning to a Conſequence.</p>
            <p>Hitherto <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s Virtue had appear'd more Military than Civil, as having found little Exerciſe ſave in War. But the profound Tranquillity he had procur'd to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, gave him leiſure to lay himſelf wholly open, and expoſe to view the other part of his Soul, which was no leſs admirable in Peaceable Functions. He had obſerv'd, that the Commonwealth of <hi>Florence</hi> had ever been attack'd on two ſides; namely, on that of <hi>Sienna,</hi> and on that of <hi>Mount Apennine.</hi> By way of Fortifying the former, he caus'd an Imperial City, call'd <hi>Poggio,</hi> to be rebuilt, upon an Eminence, and Peopl'd it with the poor Inhabitants of <hi>Poggibonzi,</hi> whoſe Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> had burnt, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving held too long out againſt his Army. And to cut off Acceſs to the ſecond, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd <hi>Fieroſola,</hi> ſituated upon the High-way
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53621:145"/>of <hi>Bologna,</hi> and enclos'd it with Walls, flank'd with new Towers, of the famous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineer, <hi>Mark Anthony de St. Gal</hi>'s Invention.</p>
            <p>But for fear the Quarrels, which often aroſe among the Neighbours of his Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, might diſturb the Repoſe it enjoy'd, by reducing it to ſide ſometimes with one, ſometimes with the other, he made a League between the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and the Lords of <hi>Perugia,</hi> and of <hi>Citta di Caſtella</hi> in <hi>Bologna,</hi> and of <hi>Sienna,</hi> whereof the two Principal Articles ſtipulated, in caſe there fell out any Difference between two of the Confederates, they ſhould be bound to ſubmit it to the Arbitrement of the reſt, and comply with the Deciſion made by Plurality of Voices; and that he of the two that refus'd acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcing in the Sentence, ſhould be conſtrain'd to it by force of Arms, which ſhould be us'd againſt her, till he had executed it to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpoſes. This Confederacy, joyn'd to the Authority <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had acquir'd in thoſe Princes Minds, render'd them ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive to him, that they did thenceforward nothing of moment but by his Counſels, and enjoy'd a profound Tranquillity during his Life.</p>
            <p>Some of them there were that endeavour'd to imitate him in the new Order he put the Affairs of his Republick, and ſtudy'd him
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53621:145"/>(as I may ſay) in his ſo improving the Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, when there was not a <hi>Florentine</hi> that durſt thwart his Intentions, by beſtowing on his Friends, in their ſeveral turns, the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Offices of State, with a juſt Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and without Men of the higheſt Quality taking any Umbrage: for tho' ſuch Perſons had not any peculiar Engagement with him, provided they were not wanting in Merit, he boggl'd not at employing them in Affairs for keeping up Decorum, and creating Emulation in others.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Florentines, Lorenzo</hi> knew, that to obviate their being Mutinous, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to produce them the Opportunities of gaining, and to procure and exhibit to them from time to time new Subjects of Divertiſements. To indulge the former of theſe two Paſſions, he devis'd putting a Sum of Money into the Hands of the Overſeers, and thoſe having the Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency of the Publick Proviſions, that they might afford them at a cheaper rate. But after he had found by experience, that they were leſs oblig'd to him for this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Liberality, and that, in caſe he continu'd, he ſhould infallibly incur the Suſpicion and Hatred of the Nobility, he chang'd his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and fell to building a Houſe of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at <hi>Cajana,</hi> where all the Poor of <hi>Florence,</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:53621:146"/>and Parts adjacent, might for a long time find occaſion of getting their Livelihood; while at certain Feaſts of the Year he took care to have Horſe-racing and Turna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereat the Youth with emulation ſhew'd their Agility.</p>
            <p>He had likewiſe Comedies acted, tho' they were not then ſo regular as afterwards under his Son's Popedom; and when his Factors at <hi>Grand Cairo</hi> had ſent him Wild-Beaſts, he made them bait and fight one another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Florentines,</hi> who were ſo much the more greedy of this Diverſion, as that <hi>Italy</hi> had not had the like Entertainment ſince the Luxury of the firſt <hi>Caeſars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as he had a nice Wit in Gallantry, as well as in all other things, he fell to refining the Carnaval Recreations, and rendring them more ingenious, and more capable of being relliſh'd by Perſons of Honour. For the better underſtanding of what I am going to ſay, it is to be ſuppos'd, that the Factions of the <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Gibellins,</hi> by obliging the Citizens of <hi>Florence</hi> to rub out Day and Night in Arms, had introduc'd into their Sports a World of Libertine Actions, which ſavour'd of War; and had at laſt degenerated into ſuch a Brutality, as that it was honourable to ſhun them, and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to frequent them; for in theſe Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53621:146"/>they onely combated for infamous Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, Feaſted onely to be drunk; the Balls were follow'd with Proſtitution; and the Theatres expos'd nothing that could be ſeen by innocent Eyes, or heard by chaſte Ears.</p>
            <p>However, <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> undertook to purifie this ſort of Feſtivals; and to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it the more cunningly, and without being expos'd at firſt to the Publick Raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he conferr'd with all the Gallants, and all the Wits of <hi>Italy,</hi> about the Reformation he intended. After which, he fram'd the Deſign of repreſenting at the Carnaval Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of Antiquity, which were becoming all ſorts of Perſons, and inſtructed at the ſame time they diverted. Thus they choſe the firſt time to give the People a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle, whoſe Repreſentation may be ſtill ſeen in a Manuſcript of the <hi>French</hi> King's Library, enrich'd with Noble Figures. It was the Combate of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and of the other Heroes that aſſiſted at the Nuptial of of <hi>Pirithous,</hi> againſt the <hi>Centaurs.</hi> The Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the Sculpters, and Architects, ſhar'd among them the Decoration of the Proſpects, and of the Publick Places: the briskeſt of the Nobility, and of the Citizens, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd by experienc'd Maſters. The Battel was ſought with all the Skill and Artifice

            </p>
            <p>His Gallantry was not confin'd to this Amuſement; for as Prizes were given in the Principal Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> for Horſe-racing, he caus'd Barbs of a prodigious fleetneſs to come from <hi>Africa,</hi> which were dreſs'd with ſo much care, that they won the Day at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Milan,</hi> at <hi>Naples,</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> and in all other Places where the Liſt was open to them. The Prizes they gain'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in Plate and Precious Stuffs, which were all employ'd in the Decoration of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, that the People ſeeing them, might with pleaſure call him to mind by whom they were Dedicated. So many Foreſights did he uſe for improving, even to the leaſt Occaſions of preſerving, or augmenting, the Love the People bore him.</p>
            <p>He did, however, all thoſe things with an Air, as ſufficiently ſhew'd his main drift was in all ſuch Contrivances chiefly to furniſh to the Publick Recreations, ſuffering little of his own time to be couzen'd with theſe Shews; for his moſt precious Hours were buſied in maintaining Peace in his Country in ſtifling the Seeds of Civil Wars, which
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53621:147"/>budded from time to time among the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines.</hi> And as he could not doubt but that this particular Peace depended on that of <hi>Italy</hi> in general, he eſtabliſh'd a Sanction among the Princes and Republicks of the Country, which laſted as long as his Life. His Cloſet became the Rendezvous of all their Deputies. In it, for four Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were terminated all the Bickerings and Differences they had with one another. In it were the Meaſures taken, they bound themſelves voluntarily to keep, and which they never broke.

In the mean while, <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s Daughter, who had married the Pope's Son, was brought to Bed of a Male Child, and his Holineſs making her a Viſit, deſir'd her
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53621:148"/>to ask of him ſome Favour. She comply'd, but not in the manner that was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for in ſtead of ſpeaking of what might pamper the Ambition of a young Woman, the Sympathy and Tenderneſs ſhe had for her young Brother the Cardinal, induc'd her to deſire onely, that he might come and dwell at <hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope, being no leſs charm'd with her Virtue, than with her incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Beauty, diſpatch'd a Courrier to <hi>Florence,</hi> to prevail with <hi>Lorenzo</hi> to recall his Son the Cardinal from <hi>Piſa,</hi> where he compleated his Studies, and to ſend him to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> with a Promiſe of conferring on him the Privileges of Cardinal-Nephew, and of conſidering him in that Quality. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> could have been very well content not to introduce his Son upon ſo great a Theatre of the World, at ſo green an Age; however, as he lov'd him too well to deprive him of a Conjuncture ſo propitious to his Fortune, he allow'd him to take a Journey to <hi>Rome;</hi> but he caus'd ſo pompous an Equipage to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for him, that tho' Luxury was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently great at the Pope's Court, by the means of the Cardinals of <hi>Naples</hi> and of <hi>Milan,</hi> where they had matriculated it of late years, nothing near his Magnificence had been ſeen. Yet this was not what <hi>Lorenzo</hi> apply'd his Thoughts moſt to; for he was
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53621:149"/>much more ſollicitous of his Son's Education, than his Train. He ſet about him ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons onely whoſe Probity was known to him; and the Governours he had in his Youth, were Men conſummated in the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Exerciſe of Politick Prudence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> did himſelf contribute to this Inſtruction, what Experience had taught him; and robbing his Sleep of the Hours he could not ſpare from Affairs, he wrote a Book after the Example of <hi>Tully</hi>'s <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> for the teaching his Son how to acquit himſelf like a Man of Quality at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> of all the Duties of Civil Life. He repreſented the Dignity of Cardinal in all its Extent; he examin'd the Talent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to maintain it: Withal, admirably well deſcribing the <hi>Genius</hi> of thoſe who were then honour'd with the Sacred Purple, and of the Principal Perſons who made a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure about his Holineſs; he ſhew'd diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Air with which he was to act with each of them in particular.</p>
            <p>Now this would be the Place to ſet down an Extract of that Book; but as it periſh'd ſo abſolutely, during <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s long Exile, that there is not the leaſt Fragment of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, we know nothing more of it, than what I have newly couch'd. <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s other Works, in Verſe and in Proſe, have not had a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Hardly had the Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and repaid the Viſits of the Sacred College, when he was oblig'd to return to <hi>Florence,</hi> by Occurrences I am going to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe. His Father, being retir'd to his Country-houſe at <hi>Carrego,</hi> to vacate to the Study of Philoſophy, with the moſt Learned of his Friends, perceiv'd a Comet, whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence was ſo malign to him, that he was taken with a Fever the ſame day. On the morrow at Noon (the Weather being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Serene, and none of the fore-running Signs of Thunder appearing the Lightning fell ſuddenly upon the Principal Church of <hi>Florence,</hi> call'd <hi>Santa Maria del Frore,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſing other Damage, than breaking the Arms of the Houſe of <hi>Medici,</hi> that were ſet upon the higheſt Pinacle. Some moments after; a hideous Noiſe was heard in the Place
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53621:150"/>where they kept the Wild Beaſts for the Peoples Diverſion; and they afterwards found, they had all mutiny'd againſt an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary great and furious Lion, ſo as that their Keepers were not able to hinder them from tearing him piece-meal, and that after this Execution they were of themſelves appeas'd.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Italians</hi> eaſily puzzle their Heads with Thoughts of the Future, they fail'd not to make Predictions upon theſe three Prodigies, which were almoſt all juſtify'd by the Event.

            <p>NEver was any Diſeaſe more trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous than that which ſeis'd <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo de Medici,</hi> on the very Day the Comet firſt appear'd. It was in the beginning onely a very ſlight Fever, and ſo much the leſs to be dreaded, in that his Friends thought they knew its Cauſes.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53621:151"/>They judg'd it to be excited by an Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on complain'd of by the Patient, and that this Obſtruction could onely be imputed to the Malignity of the Rhewm, of which he ſuffred ev'ry Moment ſtrange Defluxions: Yet the Fits continuing, tho' not augmenting, <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s Relations and Adherents ſent for <hi>Piero Leoni,</hi> the moſt celebrated Phyſician in <hi>Italy,</hi> from <hi>Spoleto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That what I am going to relate, may be the better underſtood, it is neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe, That this <hi>Leoni</hi> was the firſt who ſince the fall of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire had thought of queſting after the Medicinal Art in the Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Authors; whereas thoſe of his time addicted to that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, commonly ſtudy'd onely the Writings of <hi>Arabian</hi> Phyſicians. He had tranſlated with ſo much fidelity and eloquence the moſt conſiderable Works of <hi>Galen,</hi> and was become ſo famous by the Novelty and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of this Performance, as to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd the Principal Profeſſor of Phyſick's Chair at <hi>Padoua,</hi> where he had taught with applauſe during ſeveral Years. But his ill <hi>Genius</hi> puſhing him into the Snare wherein moſt Phyſicians were then entangled, (I mean) Judicial Aſtrology, he was become ſo expert that way, as to be conſulted from all Parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> One day the Fancy took
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:53621:152"/>him to calculate his own Nativity. He found he was born under ſo malign a Conſtellation, that he muſt infallibly be drown'd by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſeen Accident. The fear he was in of this falling out accordingly, made him quit <hi>Padoua,</hi> as being call'd to <hi>Venice,</hi> whither he could not go but by Water: And that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, by making a long abode at <hi>Padoua,</hi> he could by no means have diſpens'd paſſing over the Bridge, which he ſuppos'd would fall under him. He had Eſtate ſufficient to ſubſiſt on any where at eaſe; and if he preferr'd dwelling in his own Country before others, he did it on the account of there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither Torrent nor River.</p>
            <p>Whereupon he return'd to <hi>Spoleto,</hi> where he remain'd Ten years, without ſetting Foot over his Threſhold. But at length his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown attracted him ſo great a number of Viſits, that Civility preſſing him to repay ſome of them, he grew inſenſibly wean'd from that hideous Apprehenſion he had har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd of Waters. He began to paſs over the Bridge on Foot, afterwards paſs'd in on Horſeback. He ſince ventur'd to Ferry over Rivers: He went by Boat on Brooks. But as Hazard does ever extraordinary things, when Prudence has reſolv'd to bring about ſome ſurpriſing Contingencies, it came into <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s Friends thoughts, to commit to
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53621:152"/>
               <hi>Leoni</hi> the Concern of his Cure. They invited him to <hi>Carrego,</hi> with all the Reaſons and Allurements of Honour and Profit, capable of tempting him; and prevail'd with him at laſt to undertake the Journey, after having been thorowly inform'd there were no Riſques for him to run. He came; ſaw the Sick Man; obſerv'd all the Symptoms of his Malady with the utmoſt exactneſs; joyn'd the Predictions of Judicial Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, to the Indications of Phyſick; and from all theſe things together, unhappily concluded, That there was nothing to be fear'd in the Diſtemper they had in hand; that there needed not any Remedy; and, that Nature, that would not fail to rouſe it ſelf in due time, would have ſufficient ſtrength to looſen and diſperſe the ill Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours which fed the Fever, and to reeſtabliſh the Patient in perfect Health. <hi>Leoni</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was follow'd with the utmoſt punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality: but they likewiſe perceiv'd, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in ſtead of making its Efforts in the Critical Days, grew ſtill weaker and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and inſenſibly ſunk and dwindl'd. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovico Sforza,</hi> having Spies throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> was inform'd how Matters ſtood. And as he had an Int'reſt in <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi>'s Life, as thinking him too Pacifick to ſuffer any Diſturbance in the Tutelage of the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:53621:153"/>Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> tho' he had uſurp'd the Station, he ſent with all diligence to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rego, Lazaro de Plaiſanza,</hi> the moſt famous Phyſician of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> dwelling then at <hi>Pavia. Lazaro</hi> viſiting the Sick, deſpair'd, of him at the very firſt, and plainly declar'd, it was impoſſible to cure him. He ſhew'd the Malignity of the Phlegm, which had ſo ſeis'd upon the Noble Parts, that Remedies were no longer capable of driving it thence. And, or that the loſs of ſo Great a Perſon augmented his Indignation, or that he was overjoy'd with having found an Occaſion to diſparage <hi>Leoni,</hi> the onely Phyſician that gave a Jealouſie to his Fame, he took delight in demonſtrating, by indubitable Proofs, and even by Trials made upon the Patient's Body, that had he been preſcrib'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Courſes, he would infallibly have reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd his priſtine Vigour.</p>
            <p>While the Family of <hi>Medici</hi> were curſing <hi>Leoni</hi>'s Negligence and Temerity, <hi>Lorenzo</hi> being inform'd that his End was near at hand, appear'd no more mov'd, than if ſome indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent News had been brought him; and carry'd his ſteadineſs of Courage to the very laſt Degree that Philoſophy teaches it can go. He comforted his Friends, gave them all the Orders and Directions he judg'd to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary after his Death; regulated his Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53621:153"/>Concerns by a Will, which could not be more humble, or judicious; and taking his leave of the World, refus'd ſeeing any other than Eccleſiaſtick and Religious Perſons. He expir'd in their Arms, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving giv'n. Tokens of a moſt Chriſtian Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and receiv'd all the Sacraments. There wanted three Months of his having accompliſh'd forty three Years, and it was not known any of his Houſe had died ſo young, of a natural Death, ſince the time of its being in Eminency. His Death plung'd all thoſe of his Family into a Conſternation, the upſhot of which was, their falling into a fury.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Piero de Medici</hi> his eldeſt Son, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from his Mother all his Impetuoſities and Tranſports, went out of the Chamber, where, according to Cuſtom, he had clos'd his Father's Eyes, when he perceiv'd <hi>Leoni</hi> croſſing the Court-yard. This Object, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf ſo unſeaſonably to his ſight, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubl'd his Rage: He ran after him to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle him; but having ſound him near a Well, whoſe Brink was not very high, he chang'd his Deſign; and as he was extraordinary ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt, he ſeis'd <hi>Leoni</hi> about the Waſte, and tumbl'd him into the Well.</p>
            <p>The Skreams of this poor Old Man, and the Noiſe he made in falling, oblig'd ſome
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:53621:154"/>Domeſticks to run to his Aſſiſtance; but the Water had already ſuffocated all the natural Heat he had remaining: Which verify'd the Prediction by which he had formerly doom'd himſelf to be drown'd. The Friends of the Houſe of <hi>Medici</hi> ſpread abroad the Rumour, That <hi>Leoni</hi> had been ſo ſenſible for the loſs of his Reputation, that he fell mad at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egio,</hi> and threw himſelf into a Well. But Providence never fails of finding out the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to manifeſt Crimes, when it has reſolv'd to puniſh them in Publick. They hinder'd for ſome time the ill Effect <hi>Piero de Medici</hi>'s Inhumanity would have had in the World, if it had been known. But there was no hindring his loſing his Life in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he bereft the unfortunate <hi>Leoni</hi> of his, as I ſhall make appear in the Sequel of this Work.</p>
            <p>Now this would be the Place to finiſh <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo de Medici</hi>'s Pourtraict; but the Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications which the moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers on Men of Learning, at <hi>Monſieur Colbert</hi>'s Recommendation, agreeably invites me to beſtow the reſt of this Book on the Merit of the onely Perſonage of the laſt Century, who ſince <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> in a Private Fortune, has render'd his Name Famous by that ſort of Magnificence.</p>
            <p>I ſay then, That <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s predominant
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53621:154"/>Inclination was ever for Learned Men. He nurs'd up theſe Squab-Virtuoſo's in Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture almoſt from the very Cradle, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd them by a rare Fore-knowledge to Sciences and Arts, whereof they would be one day capable, when as they were yet but learning to read. He prevail'd with the <hi>Florentines</hi> to build them Schools, and gave them Annual Penſions out of his own Eſtate. He was the juſt Eſtimator of true Virtue, in what Place ſoever it was found. He did not content himſelf with careſſing the Muſes, and receiving them commonly at his Table, (as did then the Kings of <hi>Hungary</hi> and of <hi>Naples</hi>) but he took the pains to exerciſe them in all ſuch kinds in which they were beſt capable of performing, nay, and to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit them by his own Example. Into their own Country did he ſend the Learned <hi>Greeks,</hi> who had made their Retreat to him after the taking of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that ſo they might buy up there the Beſt and moſt Ancient Manuſcripts, that had been pillag'd; and gave them for that purpoſe ſuch conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sums, that they brought enow back again to form that famous Library, one part of whoſe Wrecks is now what is moſt Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in that of the <hi>French</hi> King. I reſerve for another Place the Hiſtory of that Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and of the ſtrange Revolutions it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53621:155"/>from the time <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd it to Plunder, unto the Regency of <hi>Catharine</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> who got, half by Force, half by Cunning, what we have now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining of it, out of the Hands of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and would never conſent, during her Life-time, that thoſe Manuſcripts ſhould be mingl'd with thoſe of the King's. I ſhall onely here ſet down one Particularity, which I have ſeen ſeveral times; namely, That moſt of thoſe Manuſcripts were bought ſo dear, that there are thoſe that coſt upon the Places a hundred Golden Crowns.</p>
            <p>This Library was put into the Palace of <hi>Medici,</hi> for an Invitation thither of the Learned'ſt Men of <hi>Europe.</hi> Proviſion was made for their daily Reception, and they had the Means afforded them of Studying with their Conveniency. Conferences were held, at which <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> aſſiſted and ſpoke in his turn. And there it was he began the Deſign of making Phyſical and Aſtronomical Experiments, which are now continu'd for the Publick Benefit, under the Direction of Prince <hi>Leopold de Medici.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They aſſembl'd on the ſame Deſign all the Antick Monuments which could ſerve to faſhion young Painters, Sculptors, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitects. All ſuch were invited thither, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> were willing to be inſtructed or perfectiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53621:155"/>in thoſe three Arts: They had excellent Maſters appointed to train them up. Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was made for the Maintenance of ſuch as needed it: And <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s Purſe was ever open to whoever lifted himſelf above what's vulgar. Aſſiſt they did at the Scrutinies which the Skilful made of their Works. They were brought to note the Defects of them. In each Piece was ſhewn them what was wanting to its attaining an ultimate Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And they were much better'd by the Emulation which was carefully nouriſh'd among them, for the finiſhing them the ſooner. From thence it came, that <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> improv'd ſo well in this Illuſtrious School, that he counterfeited at nineteen years of age an Antick Head, in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as that it was impoſſible to diſtinguiſh the Original from the Copy.</p>

Thither had they attracted, by the greatneſs of the Recompence, the moſt renown'd Profeſſors of other Univerſities. There were they maintain'd with Luſtre. And to tempt Strangers to come thither in greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, young Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> went to ſtudy in this place the Civil and Canon Law. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> took ever and anon a Journey thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to judge of the Progreſs, and diſtribute the Prizes to the Students: But he never went, without taking along ſeven Learned Men, whom he had cull'd out from among others, with them to eſtabliſh a peculiar Engagement. The firſt was <hi>Johannes Picus de la Mirandola:</hi> The ſecond, <hi>Angelus Politia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus:</hi> The third, <hi>Marſileo Ficino:</hi> The fourth, <hi>Chriſtofano Laudini: Johannes Laſcaris,</hi> the fifth: The ſixth, <hi>Demetrius Calchondilas:</hi> And the ſeventh, <hi>Marcellus Trachamontano.</hi> Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I ſhall not firſt ſpeak of them. And leſt it be imagin'd, that I mean to prefer them before the other Wits which appear'd, in that moſt happy Conjuncture, I rank them according to the Order of Times they came acquainted with <hi>Lorenzo;</hi> and I begin with the famous <hi>Leonard,</hi> who, for that he was born in the City of <hi>Arezzo,</hi> upon the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of <hi>Florence,</hi> took upon him the Name
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53621:157"/>of <hi>Aretine.</hi> He was already very old, when he beſtow'd his Cares on <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi>'s firſt Education, and enjoy'd all the Glory acquir'd him by his Sufficiency and long La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. He began to be famous at eighteen years of age: And as he had got a Fancy in his Head, to re-introduce in <hi>Europe</hi> the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, which had been neglected ſince the Inundation of the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nations, and that he had ſucceeded that way to admiration, he made himſelf neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which did not then refrain keeping ſecret Correſpondencies with the Eaſtern Biſhops, tho' ſeparated from their Communion. Thus <hi>Aretin</hi> was call'd from <hi>Florence,</hi> where he ſtill ſtudied, and Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Seventh made him his Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And as he was extraordinary parcimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, he ſcrap'd together in that Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a Fund ſufficient to ſpend the reſt of his Days at eaſe, and then made an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Retreat into his Country, where he might have enjoy'd in quiet the Advantages of his Fortune, if the ſame ſparing Humour wherewith he was beſieg'd, had not thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own Happineſs. This Infirmity ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him almoſt generally contemptible, and trumpt him up the Averſion of ſuch People as knew not otherwiſe his Merit. The facetious <hi>Artofe</hi> compos'd a kind of Novel
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:53621:158"/>in imitation of <hi>Boccacio,</hi> wherein he wittily laſh'd and railly'd <hi>Aretine,</hi> by repreſenting his ſtroaling, vagabond Humour about hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Treaſures, ſpending Day and Night in telling Gold and Silver, and buſied with new Contrivances to heap up Pelf. He alſo drew him penſive and thoughtful upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Uſuries, and ſo prodigiouſly thirſty after anothers Good, that all the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Pago</hi> and of <hi>Pactolus,</hi> which God <hi>Mammon</hi> pour'd into his Mouth, could not quench his Thirſt. <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> however, did not miſs of prevailing with him, by ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing ſomething to his Avidity, to engage him afterwards to labour for the Publick. And by this innocent Stratagem was it, that <hi>Aretine</hi> fell of himſelf to tranſlate <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Problems into <hi>Latin</hi> with the utmoſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and wrote very judiciouſly the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of his own Country. He liv'd above Fourſcore years, dying however ſoon enough not to receive in his Life time the Affront he had merited by a notorious Larceny. He had met with a new Manuſcript of <hi>Proco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> his <hi>Gothique</hi> Hiſtory, and imagining there was never another extant, none having been found among the Books ſav'd from the Pillage of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the Whim took him to burn it, after having printed the Work under his own Name, without fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:53621:158"/>to paſs for an Infamous Plagiary with Poſterity. This Changeling, while <hi>Aretine</hi> liv'd, redounded much to his Honour: But ſcarce were his Eyes clos'd, than that <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoforo Perſona</hi> ſaid, he had got another Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript of the ſaid <hi>Procopius,</hi> containing the Wars of the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> beſides thoſe of the <hi>Goths,</hi> and caus'd them to be printed, with a Preface ſo injurious to <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>'s Memory, that his being no longer in a condition to read it, was reckon'd for none of the leaſt of his Good-fortunes. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over his Heirs were ſo little careful of the Works he had not yet publiſh'd, that the better part of them would be ſtill unknown, if the Learned <hi>Monſieur de la Mare,</hi> Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor in the Parliament of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> had not taken the pains to poak them out of the Duſt of the moſt famous Libraries, principally out of that of the moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> King, and of the Great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and collected them into a Volumn.</p>
            <p>The gay, facetious <hi>Poggio</hi> labour'd at the ſame time with <hi>Aretine</hi> on <hi>Lorenzo de Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci</hi>'s Education, and infinitely contributed to diſpel what appear'd too gloomy in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy. He had travell'd throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> and moſt induſtriouſly viſited the Archives of Monaſteries. He was the firſt that found out <hi>Tully</hi>'s Books which treat of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:53621:159"/>
               <note n="*" place="margin">De Finibus &amp; Legibus.</note>
               <hi>Laws,</hi> and of <hi>the Ends of Good and Evil.</hi> He had likewiſe the good luck to diſcover <hi>Quintilian</hi>'s Inſtitutions, and his firſt Nineteen Declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as he was feretting the Shop of a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Grocer, juſt as he was going to tear them, to make Wrappers of for his Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. And thoſe who know, that this was the onely Copy in the World, will have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Obligations to <hi>Poggio</hi>'s Memory. <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> the Fourth, and <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Fifth, made uſe of him in Quality of Secretary. And this Commiſſion would have gain'd him vaſt Riches, if he himſelf, by the following Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, had not contributed to his own Diſgrace. He was naturally Curious, and yet his Converſation extreme diverting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe never Man proceeded ſooner or more imperceptibly, from the ſtarched'ſt, ſevereſt Gravity, into the freeſt Mirth and Gaiety. This Quality, which made him one in all gallant Meetings and Entertainments, would have advanc'd him very high, if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd within any bounds his eaſie proneneſs to Drollery. But People began to grow weary of affording him Attention, when they ſaw him laſh out into the moſt keen and poynant Satyr, and not valuing to loſe a Friend, rather than not have the Pleaſure of ſpringing a Witticiſm. One day that
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:53621:159"/>they were Criticizing the Briefs, (as was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary) in a company of Learned Men, <hi>Poggio</hi> could not endure that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended one drawn up by <hi>Giorgiodi Trebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zond,</hi> and this Satyrical Verſe ſtarted from him:
<q>Graeculus eſuriens ad Coelum juſſeris, ibit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>George</hi> not underſtanding Raillery, anſwer'd him immediately with a Cuff or two on the Ear, which were follow'd with ſo general a Laughter, that <hi>Poggio</hi> was conſtrain'd to ſtep aſide and leave <hi>Rome</hi> on the morrow, where he rightly judg'd, there was nothing more for him to do, after ſuch an Affront. Thus he return'd to <hi>Florence,</hi> where he tranſlated into <hi>Latin</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Hiſtory of <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> and made excellent Tracts on the Infidelity of Princes, on the Capriciouſneſs of Fortune, and the Contagion of Avarice. But as it was fatal to him to detract ever to his Coſt, he attack'd <hi>Lorenzo Val,</hi> of whom it was then ſaid, That Nature had kneaded him all of Choler. And indeed, he anſwer'd <hi>Pog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio</hi> with ſuch fell Scurrilities and Execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that he made him quit the Match, to ſet upon the Hiſtory of his Country, which he wrote in <hi>Latin</hi> competently pure, and <hi>Giacomo Poggio</hi> his Son tranſlated it with
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:53621:160"/>much Elegancy into <hi>Italian.</hi> But this Work was happy neither for the Author, nor the Tranſlator; for they kept ſo little modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their commending the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and decrying their Adverſaries, that they could neither be accounted bad Citizens, nor good Hiſtorians, as <hi>Sannazar</hi> twits them by this excellent Epigram.

            <p>The Father dy'd a little afore the <hi>Pazzi's</hi> Conſpiracy; and the Son being engag'd among thoſe coop'd up in the Town-houſe of <hi>Florence,</hi> in thinking to ſurpriſe it, <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo de Medici</hi> in vain endeavour'd to ſave him from the Rope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ambroſio da Camaldoli</hi> was the firſt Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of his time, who apply'd his Mind to the Study of Polite Letters, He tranſlated the Work of the Hierarchy attributed to St. <hi>Denis,</hi> with ſo much eloquence and neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that none have ſince come near his Style. But he ſped not ſo well in the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of <hi>Diogenes Laertius.</hi> He was Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of his Order, and the Popes <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Fourth, and <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Fifth, could not entice him from his Solitude, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:53621:160"/>to him the Dignity of Cardinal, as an Attraction to get him to the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> He perſever'd in his Hermitage unto a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found old age, in an healthful Chearfulneſs, which procur'd him the Viſits of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy'ſt Perſons in <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> and he it was <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo de Medici</hi> pitch'd on to reconcile <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo Val</hi> with <hi>Poggio.</hi> He endeavour'd it for a long while, but with ſo little Succeſs, that they ſince gave him reaſon to averr, in a Letter written to the Prince of <hi>Mirandola,</hi> That he had found them neither <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> nor Men of Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antonio da Palermo</hi> was born at <hi>Bologna,</hi> of the Illuſtrious Family of <hi>Beccarelli;</hi> but without any Eſtate. He had Eight hundred Crowns Penſion to teach Hiſtory to the laſt Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Viſconti,</hi> from whence he went to <hi>Naples,</hi> to be King <hi>Alfonſo</hi>'s Secretary. He accompany'd that Prince in all his Wars and Voyages, and was Eye-witneſs of moſt of the Wonders he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of him, in a Book that has had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be enrich'd and re-touch'd by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Second. He was very Moderate for the firſt Sev'nty years of his Life: but at Sev'nty one, a fair Maid of <hi>Naples,</hi> call'd <hi>Marcilla,</hi> inſpir'd him with Love, and made him think on Marriage. He had by her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Children, and dy'd Ten years after,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53621:161"/>with ſo little Pain and Diſtraction, that a moment before he expir'd, he made his own Epitaph.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lorenzo Val</hi> was the firſt <hi>Roman</hi> in whoſe Head it came to repair the Damage the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous-Nations had done the Study of the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue. He compos'd Books of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, which quickned the <hi>Roman</hi> Youth with a Deſire to hunt in the Works of the Ancients for the Purity of Expreſſions, that had been natural to them. He carefully tranſlated <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Thucydides,</hi> tho' his Fidelity has ſince been much queſtion'd by <hi>Henry Eſtienno,</hi> in thoſe two Works. But he was of ſo malign a Diſpoſition, that he could not ſpeak of any Man without Detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. He took fire on the leaſt occaſion; and when he had once begun to ferment, it was impoſſible for him to abſtain from the bittereſt Invectives, or to be brought to a Reconciliation with thoſe he had offended. Thus finding no longer any one to Criticiſe upon in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> he remov'd to that of <hi>Naples,</hi> where he got immediately into Credit, by the Offer he made to write the moſt Illuſtrious Actions of <hi>Naples.</hi> He went about it with all his might, but with ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Succeſs, that his Adverſaries had reaſon to upbraid him, That he had fall'n himſelf into all the Faults, which he had ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:53621:161"/>in others. This Diſgrace, it's thought, made him baniſh himſelf from King <hi>Alfonſo</hi>'s Court; and that the anxiety of ſurviving his Reputation, made him take pet and die, at Fifty years of age. And the <hi>Romans</hi> could hardly be prevail'd with to ſuffer him to be bury'd in the Church of <hi>Lateran,</hi> whereof he was a Canon, for that he had made way for others to doubt of their Pretenſions, by writing againſt the Donation of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to Pope <hi>Sylveſter.</hi> They would have had more reaſon to conteſt him ſo honourable a Sepulture, on the ſcore of the Scandal and Ill Example he had giv'n in the Commonwealth of Learning, by firſt publiſhing whole Books of Invectives and Recriminations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fabius Blondus</hi> was born at <hi>Furli,</hi> of the Scum of the People, and earn'd Preferment and a Name, by his Courage, in undertaking to write the huge Decades of the Civil Wars of <hi>Italy;</hi> whoſe Memoirs were upon the point of being loſt, becauſe there was not a Perſon willing to apply his Endeavours to ſo tedious and irkſom a Subject. He ſince compos'd another Piece, of the Revolutions hapning during the Decaydency and Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, with ſo much ſatisfaction to Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> the Fifth, who ſet him to work, that he made great Gains by
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:53621:162"/>this Atchievement; and it is verily believ'd he would have attain'd to the moſt eminent Dignities, had he not preferr'd Wedlock to an Eccleſiaſtick State. He marry'd a <hi>Roman</hi> Lady of great Quality, by whom he had ſeveral Children, who had the Misfortune to become miſerably poor; he dy'd at Seventy years old, and was bury'd at the Door of our Lady of <hi>Ara Coeli.</hi> I have ſometimes made enquiry how it comes this Author is ſo little known, and have found no other Cauſe, but that he had the misfortune, a hundred years after his Death, that <hi>Carolus Sigonius</hi> took a fancy to write upon the ſame Subject: And as he was leſs entangl'd, and more methodick than <hi>Blondus,</hi> he raviſh'd him of his Reputation with ſo much exceſs, that he now ſerves onely for Parade in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries, tho' otherwiſe no Man can deny, but that <hi>Sigonius</hi> is almoſt all along the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giary of <hi>Blondus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Candidus December</hi> went from <hi>Vigevano,</hi> where he was born, to <hi>Milan.</hi> He became the beſt Critick in <hi>Europe,</hi> in <hi>Lorenzo Val</hi>'s Judgment, who never commended any other Grammarian of his time, ſave <hi>Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</hi> He was the firſt Tranſlator of <hi>Appi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus Alexandrinus,</hi> which he did not ſpeed in, however skilful in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues, becauſe he had made uſe of ſo faulty
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:53621:162"/>a Manuſcript, that he had been conſtrain'd to ſupply in ſeveral Places, upon feeble Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, what was wanting to the Text. But, in recompence, he wrote the Life of <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippo Viſconti</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> in a Style ſo like to that of <hi>Suetonius,</hi> that none have ſince been able to come near it, no not <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus-Jovius,</hi> tho' he has endeavour'd it in the Life of the Great <hi>Sforza,</hi> ſirnam'd <hi>Attendula.</hi> True it is, he has ting'd and daſh'd it with things ſo highly ſhocking Modeſty, that it's a wonder, that, this notwithſtanding, his Work has been infinitely eſteem'd. He dy'd aged Fourſcore, and was bury'd near the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary of <hi>St. Ambroſio,</hi> which had been long under his Care.</p>
            <p>It is not without ſome Confuſion, that I ſpeak here of that famous <hi>Algionus,</hi> tho' he was the Learned'ſt <hi>Venetian</hi> of his Age, and that we have Letters of his, written with the utmoſt politeneſs, to <hi>Lorenzo de Medici.</hi> However, thoſe who know him, have not been able to excuſe him from two great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities: The one, of getting drunk as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as he found the occaſion: And the other, of having depriv'd Poſterity of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Works, of which he had got the Manuſcript. This wretched Plagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was under an Obligation of comforting the Proveditor <hi>Cornaro,</hi> in the Baniſhment
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:53621:163"/>he was doom'd to, for having been routed in making War upon the <hi>Turks,</hi> tho' the Fault was none of his. <hi>Algionus</hi> ſent him the Book entit'led <hi>De fortiter toleranda Exilii fortuna.</hi> And as this Tract was wholly compos'd of Sentences ſorrily tack'd and jumbl'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and fitted out of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Book of <hi>Glory,</hi> yet was it much eſteem'd, tho' the Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eaſily obſerv'd it had not any Connexion. <hi>Algionus,</hi> overjoy'd at the Succeſs of his Work, chang'd the deſign he had had of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Piece to be printed: And as he knew there was no other Copy of it to be had, he committed it to the Flames, for fear there ſhould be one day found among his Papers Matter for his Conviction. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, he repented it tow'rds the end of his Life, and made a kind of an attoning Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Apology at the Head of two Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues, which he compos'd at <hi>Venice,</hi> upon the Deſolation of <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Lutherians.</hi> The Publick is indebted to him for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs which <hi>Aldus Manucius</hi> us'd in the Impreſſion of the beſt <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors we now admire; for he was all his Life Corrector of that famous Preſs.</p>
            <p>Never Man became more Learned, with leſs Health, and more Engagements incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with Study, than <hi>Donatus.</hi> I ſpeak of him that iſſu'd from the Illuſtrious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53621:163"/>of the <hi>Acagholli</hi> at <hi>Florence.</hi> His Life was very ſhort; being almoſt wholly ſpent in the moſt weighty and conſiderable Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of the Republick. This notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he fail'd not tranſlating <hi>Ariſtotle's Morals</hi> much more exactly than thoſe who had gone before him in that ſort of Labour, nor of purging them with an admirable Commentary, of ridiculous Interpretations giv'n them by the Ancients, and new So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſts. Wherein he ſhew'd, That whoſoever engages himſelf in this Labyrinth, without another Guide than the famous <hi>Euſtachius,</hi> cannot avoid going aſtray. He found like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe time to tranſlate the Lives of <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Illuſtrious Men, being the beſt Verſion we have of them in <hi>Latin;</hi> and to write a Book in Praiſe of <hi>Charles-Main,</hi> in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for that Prince his having built or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh'd the City of <hi>Florence.</hi> He was a Confident of <hi>Lorenzo de Medici;</hi> and 'twas upon his Requeſt he undertook a Journey into <hi>France,</hi> to ſollicit at that Court Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours for his Country, againſt Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fourth. He dy'd at <hi>Milan,</hi> ag'd Thirty eight years, and three Months after the <hi>Pazzi's</hi> Conſpiracy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Franciſcus Philelphus</hi> of <hi>Tolentin</hi> was ſo enamour'd of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, that he would needs go view the Ruines of <hi>Athens,</hi>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:53621:164"/>to try if the Air of the Country could in any wiſe contribute to his Sufficiency. From thence he paſs'd thorow <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he married <hi>Emanuel Chryſolorus</hi> his Daughter, meerly for her pronouncing admirably well the ancient and new <hi>Greek.</hi> This Woman being intriguing, made her Husband known to the Emperour <hi>Palaeologus,</hi> who ſent him in Quality of Ambaſſador to the Chriſtian Princes, to demand Succours againſt the <hi>Turks, Philelphus</hi> his Negotiation was of no benefit to the Emperour, but accru'd to his own advantage; for it brought him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted over all <hi>Europe,</hi> and principally at <hi>Florence,</hi> where <hi>Lorenzo</hi> engag'd him to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate the Works of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and <hi>Xenophon</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:53621:165"/>Archbiſhop; which perchance hinder'd him from publiſhing it in his Life-time. He dy'd very old; and the Author of his Epitaph had reaſon to uſe theſe Words onely, <hi>Here lies the Tranſlator of Polybius:</hi> For if the Work is <hi>Perroti</hi>'s, none of all thoſe who have made the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſpeak <hi>Latin,</hi> not onely can be compar'd to him, or in any wiſe come near him.</p>

But as he was naturally ambitious, and that he affected to bottom his own Repute by diſcloſing the Ignorance of others, he created ſo great a number his Enemies, that he would
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:53621:166"/>have found it a hard puſh to anſwer all the Writings drawn up againſt him, if he had not been reliev'd by a Fever, which cut him off very young.

               <hi>Antonius Campanus</hi> his Fortune was no leſs capricious than his <hi>Genius.</hi> An unknown Country-Girl was deliver'd of him under a Tree, where ſhe bilkt him. He was found there by a Sexton Prieſt of the Church, who put the Bantling out to Nurſe, through a pure Principle of Charity; for he had more the Form of an Ape, than of a Child. This Prieſt taught him to read, and put him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards into the Service of a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman going to Study at <hi>Naples. Campanus</hi> attended his Maſter to the College, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Man of ſuch Learning, as at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn he ſtood for and obtain'd a Publick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors Chair at <hi>Perruza.</hi> This Exerciſe brought him to the knowledge of Pope <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the Second, who made him Biſhop of <hi>Ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rano;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the Second ſince conferr'd on him other Benefices. But he could not avoid being diſgrac'd under <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fourth, becauſe that Pope having vow'd the Ruine of the Race of <hi>Vitelli,</hi> for Reaſons I have
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53621:167"/>inſerted in the Second Book, thought it needful before all things to rid <hi>Campanus</hi> out of the way, he having too ſtrict an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with this Houſe. And indeed, he ſent him into Exile, wherein he dy'd of the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Sickneſs. He left ſeveral Works, the moſt conſiderable of which would be the Life of the famous Captain <hi>Braccio,</hi> had he not blended it with ſo many Fables, that the moſt knowing in the Hiſtory of <hi>Italy</hi> in the Fifteenth Century, can in it hardly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh Truth from Eiction.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Beſſarion</hi> was a Man ſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd, that the Sacred Purple had never clad his like.

               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:53621:167"/>was the moſt Worthy of being their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor; and it's well known, that he would have been Pope after <hi>Paul</hi> the Second, but for the Imprudence of <hi>Nicolo Perroti,</hi> the ſame I have already mention'd, who ſerv'd him for Conclaviſt. One Evening, that <hi>Beſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarion</hi> was ſtudying, as was his Cuſtom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out troubling his Head with the Intrigues of his Colleagues, three Cardinals, the Heads of as many Cabals in the Conclave, having at length agreed for the Election of him, went to his Cell, and ask'd to ſpeak with him. <hi>Perroti</hi> fancying all their Buſineſs was to hedge in the Suffrages of his Patron; and as he knew him well enough to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that theſe Cardinals Sollicitations would (as to that) be ineffectual, he thought it his Duty not to interrupt <hi>Beſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>'s Study. Wherefore he obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to introduce them, or to acquaint his Patron of their asking to come to his Speech. And what was moſt capricious in this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, the more <hi>Perroti</hi> was entreated, preſs'd, conjur'd, threatn'd, the more ſtiff and refractory he was to keep the Door ſhut; all this ſo much the more confirming him in his Chimerical Preſuppoſition, That they were ſo earneſt for admittance, onely to mump the onely Voice they wanted for him among them they had agreed upon. The
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53621:168"/>Conteſt laſted ſo long, that the three Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals Patience being tir'd, they ſaid to one another, <hi>A fine Buſineſs truly would it be, to exalt a Man to the Holy See, who not onely would not con them any Thanks for his Election, but alſo make them depend on the Caprice of his Domeſticks, when they ſhould have occaſion to Diſcourſe him.</hi> Then Spite and Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made them take other Meaſures; and as Cardinal <hi>Riario</hi> was the He moſt flatter'd their Imagination in that inſtant, they ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him Pope, tho' they had concerted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to give their Voice to any Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and that <hi>Riario</hi> had been a <hi>Cordelier.</hi> The Pleaſure they expected to reap from Cardinal <hi>Beſſarion</hi>'s Regret, for having miſt the Papacy through his Conclaviſt's Fault, ſet them agog to let him know how the thing had paſs'd: But this neither chang'd <hi>Beſſarion</hi>'s Countenance or Carriage to them, and he onely told <hi>Perroti,</hi> That he had hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him from dubbing him Cardinal. The new Pope having a mind to reduce the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into a Monarchy, could no longer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſight of a Perſon he knew to have been ſo near the Place he held, and merit it much better than his Holineſs. He contriv'd, for the getting him out of the way, an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sham, which was, to ſend <hi>Beſſarion</hi> in Quality of Legate into <hi>France,</hi> where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53621:168"/>a long while, and gave <hi>Budoeus</hi> the firſt Tincture of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue; for that Kingdom had not a Man that underſtood it at that time.

               <hi>George de Trebiſonde</hi> was one of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Men of Letters that came from <hi>Greece</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> after the Revolution of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi> He tranſlated the Works of <hi>Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Coeſarea,</hi> part of thoſe of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and the Rhetorick of <hi>Hermogenes.</hi> He was inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable in Labour; but beſides his having the Mien and Manners of a Pedant, he loſt his Fame by the unjuſt. War he made upon <hi>Plato:</hi> He had got a Fancy, that the onely way to exalt his own Repute above that of other Learned Men, conſiſted in defaming that Philoſopher: and as he was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily virulent in all he went about, he wrote againſt him ſuch invidious, Satyrical Libels, as render'd himſelf altogether ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. He receiv'd likewiſe the diſpleaſure of ſeeing, that among the Learned, all thoſe making Profeſſion of Virtue, defended the Doctrine of <hi>Plato</hi> with the ſame Zeal, as if it had been (as I may ſay) the Out-works of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion. Cardinal <hi>Beſſarion</hi> of his <hi>Mecaenas</hi> became his Adverſary, and anſwer'd him with ſo much Solidity and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53621:169"/>as ſtopp'd his Mouth. He did not deſiſt, however, after this Quarrel, teaching at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he marry'd; but ſome years after he had a Fit of Sickneſs, which made him ſo univerſally forget what he had learn'd, that he retain'd not ſo much as his own Name. He did not recover, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out becoming again an Infant; and dy'd, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having tir'd out his Children and Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks for above ten years together, with following him where ever the Fancy put him upon going, for fear of his inſulting thoſe he met; for notwithſtanding all his Imbeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, he would never endure to be ſhut up Day or Night.</p>

               <hi>Theodore Gaza</hi> departed very young from the City of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> the Place of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and came into <hi>Italy,</hi> where he was immediately obſerv'd to have a Wit prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly quick and pregnant, He attain'd in a ſhort ſpace the Delicacy of the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, and became ſo nice, as gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to doubt, if he underſtood it not better than the <hi>Greek,</hi> tho' it was not queſtion'd but that he admirably well knew the Tongue of his own Country. And indeed, he was the onely Perſon, of whom People have not hitherto been able to judge which he tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated beſt, <hi>Greek</hi> into <hi>Latin,</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> into <hi>Greek;</hi> for, if we on one ſide examine the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53621:169"/>Verſion he made of the Problems of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>'s Hiſtory of Animals, of that of Plants of <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> and of the Aphoriſms of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> we ſhall find, that he has not onely expreſs'd the Thoughts and the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of thoſe Authors, but has likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd all their Graces, which ſeem'd as if they could in no wiſe be divorc'd from their Expreſſions: And if, on the other ſide, we conſider the Air wherewith he makes <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeak <hi>Greek,</hi> it will be more difficult (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compariſon) to comprehend the inimita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Turn he found the way to give to that Oratour Traveſty'd, to make him retain all the Majeſty of his Eloquence, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving enfeebl'd the Beauty of his Sentiments, or the Purity of his Style. Cardinal <hi>Beſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> had procur'd him a Benefice in the Realm of <hi>Naples,</hi> on which he might very conveniently have ſubſiſted, if his natural averſeneſs for all ſorts of Menial Cares had not oblig'd him to refer them abſolutely to his own Country People, who let him almoſt want all manner of Neceſſaries. They made him believe, the Lands had been ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd, ſometimes by Storms, and ſometimes by extraordinary Droughts. Honeſt <hi>Gaza</hi> lov'd rather to believe their Lies, than take the pains to inquire into the Truth of their Aſſeverations. However, he did not leave
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53621:170"/>off working with as much Exactneſs and Perſeverance, as if he had had all his Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies. And when he had finiſh'd the Piece he deſign'd for Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fourth, he tranſcrib'd it himſelf upon Parchment, (for he painted admirably well) and preſented it to his Holineſs. But the good Man had made his Addreſs in the wrong place; for the Pope, who had liv'd Fifty years among the <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> had deprav'd his Taſte, by ſtudying the Formalities of <hi>Scotus.</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd <hi>Gaza</hi>'s Book with as lowring a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, as if he had offer'd him a Song: He threw it into a Corner of the Room, and calling his Chamberlain, bid him give the Author ſo mean a Sum, that it was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to pay for the Velome on which th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Marcilus Tarcaniote</hi> came from <hi>Greece</hi> into <hi>Italy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> with a company of Cuiraſſeers, and mingled all his life long, the Pike with the Pen; the Profeſſion of Arms, with that of Polite Letters. His fondneſs for the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, made him wed the Daughter of <hi>Bartolomeo Scula,</hi> who underſtood and ſpoke it to an admirable Perfection. She taught it him ſo accurately, that <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> found him capable of tranſlating <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Moral Works, and conjur'd him to do it by Letters ſtill extant. But he had ſo much averſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for that ſort of Labour, wherein a Man muſt (ſaid he) render himſelf a Slave of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Sentiments, that it was impoſſible for him to finiſh the firſt Page. He lov'd much rather to compoſe Epigrams, whereof there is a Collection ſtill remaining, wherein a body may ſee that it was ſolely his own fault, he did not do much more. He was drown'd in fording the River of <hi>Volterra,</hi> ſwell'd extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily by the Rains, on the very day that the unfortunate <hi>Lodovico Sforza</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to an Eternal Priſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Demetrius Chalcondile</hi> had all the good Qualities of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and none of the bad, He was Knowing and Laborious, never wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Studying or Teaching, ſincere, and never boaſting. He came very aged to <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> where he muſt needs be dabbling in
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:53621:173"/>Matrimony. The little diſpoſition he had to meddle in Domeſtick concerns, induc'd him to leave thoſe Sollicitudes to his Wife; and this freedom, ſo extraordinary in <hi>Tuſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> with that Ladies wonderful Fecondity, ſerv'd for matter to a world of Verſes, diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to her Modeſty. After <hi>Argi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropolis</hi> had quit the <hi>Greek</hi> Chair of <hi>Florence, Politian</hi> obtain'd it; and as he was an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Wit, uſing all the ways of making him ſucceſsful in his Undertakings, he ſo well brandiſh'd his Talent, and ſo ſlily coax'd and flatter'd his Auditory, that he wrought an Excluſion to all the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who offer'd to diſpute for it. <hi>Chalcondile,</hi> tho' very humble, and little minding his own Glory, cou'd not digeſt the affront that was done thoſe of his Nation. He made his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> who had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy pitch'd upon him to reach his Children the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, and obtained Permiſſion to teach in Concurrence, and at the ſame time with <hi>Politian,</hi> to ſee which of the two wou'd have moſt Followers. But the harſh accent which <hi>Chalcondile</hi> cou'd never get rid of, and the difficulty he had to pronounce ſome <hi>Latin</hi> words, rendred him Contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in compariſon of <hi>Politian,</hi> whoſe agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able tone of Voice, and gallant Expreſſions, raviſh'd his whole Audience. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:53621:173"/>by all means to keep <hi>Chalcondile</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> was forc'd to procure him Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and endeavour'd to oblige <hi>Politian</hi> to live with him more civilly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lorenzo</hi> ſet about ſeveral times to reconcile them, but he found by his own experience, that it was more eaſie to procure Peace to <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> than make it between two Virtuoſo's. He hindred them however from letting their Reſentment break out, during his Life-time, but incontinently after his Death, <hi>Chalcondile</hi> being without ſupport, ſided with <hi>Lodovico Sforza,</hi> who gave him the principal Chair at <hi>Milan,</hi> where he committed to the Preſs his Illuſtrations upon the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, that have rendred him ſo famous. There he dy'd, when near a hundred years old, and yet ſoon enough not to be informed of the ſhameful death of <hi>Theophilus,</hi> the Eldeſt of his Children, kill'd by Night in a bye ſtreet of <hi>Pavia,</hi> where he was Profeſſor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marc-Muſurus,</hi> a Native of <hi>Candia,</hi> where he had already ſignaliz'd his parts, by his Criticiſme upon the <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, and by the rare felicity of his Genius, which almoſt equally accompliſh'd all he undertook, when that the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> made him remove from his Iſland to the <hi>Terra-firma,</hi> and gave him a Chair at <hi>Padoua.</hi> The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Auditors was there ſo great, that
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:53621:174"/>they were forced to enlarge the publick School, and permit <hi>Muſurus</hi> to teach Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar in the morning, and Poetry in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, to gratifie thoſe who had a mind to hear him unfold thoſe two liberal Arts. He continued to Profeſs, till the War deſerted his Auditory, and compelled him himſelf to think of his Security. He withdrew to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he compoſed that wonderfull Poem in praiſe of <hi>Plato,</hi> which is found at the beginning of that Philoſophers Works. Thoſe who underſtood it, and ſaw him, could (at firſt) hardly believe <hi>Muſurus</hi> to be the Author. They were rather inclin'd to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect he had found it in an ancient Manuſcript, and publiſht it in his own Name. Their Diffidence was grounded upon its not being poſſible for a Man of their time, to compoſe a piece wherein the Character, and Grace ſtroaks the <hi>Greek</hi> Poetry poſſeſs'd in <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>'s Age, were reſtor'd in the higheſt point of their Perfection <hi>Muſurus</hi> help'd on his ſide to confirm them in this thought, when judging of the Beauty of his Poem, by the Applauſes it received from all Parties, he would compile nothing more of that Nature, for fear of diminiſhing by a feeble piece, or leſs finiſh'd, the high Reputation he had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd unexpectedly, and on a ſudden. He contented himſelf with ſhowing, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:53621:174"/>to the <hi>Romans,</hi> the fineſt paſſages of <hi>Homer,</hi> of <hi>Heſiod,</hi> of <hi>Theocritus,</hi> and of <hi>Anacreon,</hi> that he was able to imitate their Quaintneſs, and Excellencies, ſince he knew ſo perfectly their Turn and Delicacy, and by leading ſo regular a Life, that People came inſenſibly to ceaſe ſuſpecting him of injuſtice. He was at this paſs when <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th was Elected Pope, that is to ſay, when the Golden Age of Polite Letters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. <hi>Muſurus</hi> received of his firſt Gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and was endow'd with the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of <hi>Raguſa.</hi> But as Dignities expoſe more in view thoſe by whom they are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd, and by conſequence their Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the better noted; the Mitre only ſerv'd <hi>Muſurus,</hi> to manifeſt the Vice he had ſo long held conceal'd; for as hitherto he had not been accounted Ambitious, and they made this judgment of him, that he had more Repute than he deſir'd. But no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was he Archbiſhop, than that he fell a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balling to be Cardinal. He laid aſide his Books, to ſtudy intriguing, and had ſuch an ability that way, that the Pope was amaz'd at this Change, twitted him with it, and ſome times railly'd him. Yet did he not forbear continuing, and took ſo many new meaſures with thoſe he ſaw Favourites at Court, that they Cock-ſur'd him of a Cap at the firſt Promotion. But
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:53621:175"/>the Pope delighted in fruſtrating their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, for his greater Diverſion at <hi>Muſurus</hi> his future behaviour. And indeed, he did not neglect tricking up his Houſe, augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Train, nay, and preparing the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment he pretended to make. But the day of Promotion being come, <hi>Muſurus</hi> not finding himſelf of the number of the one and thirty, added to the Sacred Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, his Virtue prov'd too weak to digeſt the Affront he fancy'd he had receiv'd. He complained of it, as of a Contempt done to all the <hi>Greek</hi> Nation in his Perſon; and for the carrying his Reſentment as far as it could go of the Dropſey he ſell ſick, and died.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Johannes Laſcaris</hi> was the moſt Illuſtrious of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that came into <hi>Italy,</hi> after the taking of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> for beſides that he reckon'd Emperours in the number of his Anceſtors, was he in ſuch repute for Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Probity, that the very Inſidels had a veneration for his Merit. He took Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> who received him with open Armes, and committed to him the care of his Library. As they were one day diſcouring on the means for its embeliſhment, a thought came into <hi>Laſcaris</hi> his head, that <hi>Bajazet</hi> the 2d, Emperour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> had an inclination for Philoſophy, and that having caus'd <hi>Averroes</hi> his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:53621:175"/>upon <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> to be explained to him, he wou'd not be ſorry that the Peripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticks were reſcu'd from the downfall of Polite Letters. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> promis'd to furniſh him with things neceſſary for a Voyage to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> if willing to go thither on this Deſign. <hi>Laſcaris</hi> took him at his Word, and embark'd without any other Credential, than the Letter which <hi>Lorenzo</hi> gave him for his Factours. Nevertheleſs he fail'd not of getting acceſs to the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s Port, and of being preſented to his <hi>Celſitude,</hi> who receiv'd him much better than he expected. They had a pretty long Converſation, and <hi>Bajazet</hi> teſtify'd to him all the Eſteem an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel was capable of, for the Virtue of <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> and allow'd him (in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of that Lord) to buy up all the Manuſcripts met with to be fold in his Empire. His <hi>Celſitude</hi> gave him Men to Conduct and Guard him to and from ſuch places, where he knew there had been Libraries, and to hinder thoſe who had plunder'd them, from ſelling the Books for more than they were worth. Thus <hi>Laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caris</hi> had the conveniency of going through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Greece,</hi> and of collecting thoſe rare Volumes, which ſtill ſubſiſt in the <hi>French</hi> King's Library; yet he brought but half of 'em in the firſt Voyage he made, becauſe the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:53621:176"/>joy he had to ſhow his Patron the Authors he had retriev'd, tho' held for loſt, made him return to <hi>Florence,</hi> juſt two years after he departed thence. But <hi>Lorenzo</hi> ſent him back three Months after, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to continue his ſearch through all places that had been the Reſidence of the Learned. <hi>Laſcaris</hi> ſaw <hi>Bajazet</hi> again, and receiv'd new Civilities from this Sultan. He travell'd o're all the <hi>Peloponeſus,</hi> and return'd as in Triumph, in a Ship freighted with the reſt of the Spoils of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue. But he had not as yet rang'd his Manuſcripts in the ſtately place appointed them, when <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo de Medici</hi> dy'd, and left <hi>Italy</hi> in a calm of no long Duration. The <hi>French</hi> Army entred <hi>Florence,</hi> and diſſipated the Books, as well as other the Moveables of the Houſe of <hi>Medici. Laſcaris</hi> not knowing what to do, ſided with <hi>Charles</hi> the 8th, and being a Man of the Cabinet, he had given him the Embaſſy of <hi>Venice,</hi> which he acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf worthily of, under the Reign of that Monarch, and of his Succeſſour, <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12th. At length, <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Pope, call'd <hi>Laſcaris</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> to be of his Council. He liv'd there as a Man of Quality, and ſpent regularly for his Table and his Equipage, all the Salaries, and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cſileaſtical Penſions he receiv'd. He lov'd
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:53621:176"/>good Chear, and had ſo much averſion for what is call'd Perking up an Author, that they had all the trouble imaginable, to get him Couch in writing the Aneients way of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping, according to <hi>Polybius</hi> his Memoirs; and the little we have left of his curious Verſes, was ſtoln from him by the Pope's order. He was very much troubled with the Gout in his old Age, and nevertheleſs attain'd to his Ninetieth year.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Groninghen,</hi> ſo little known before it had brought <hi>Rodolphus Agricola</hi> into the World, began to be celebrated for his Birth. So great was his Wit, that he learnt at the firſt, and without pains, all he had a mind to ſtudy, and a memory ſo vaſt, that nothing eſcap'd him of what he had once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd. Theſe two rare Talents, joyn'd to an indefatigable Temperament, ſupply'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly the lowneſs of his Extraction, and his Domeſtick Poverty. He became Learned to a Prodigy, with borrow'd books, and without a Maſter; and the very things he confuſedly learnt, and according as they occur'd in Authors, that were lent him, were found diſpos'd in a marvellous order and nearneſs, when he pronounc'd them. He began his Studies, where others were wont to ſmiſh them; that is to ſay, with the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue. He wou'd know it not
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:53621:177"/>only in its Purity, but likewiſe with all the Alterations produc'd by time, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements of the <hi>Rabbi's.</hi> He was alſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to initiate himſelf into the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, the principal Authors of which he read with ſo much Accuracy, that his Co-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours have ſince own'd, they could never know of which he was moſt Maſter. At laſt he fell to <hi>Latine,</hi> without having regard to the Remonſtrances of thoſe who diſſuaded him from that Province, for that the habit of writing and pronouncing <hi>Hebrew,</hi> ſeem'd to have introduc'd in his Mind, an incompatibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with the <hi>Roman Phraſes</hi> and Expreſſions. In <hi>Latine</hi> he made ſo ſurprizing a Progreſs, that the famous <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> an Author ſo little accuſtomed to commend in another, the Riches he enjoy'd, cou'd not grow weary of admiring him, principally, after he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd on the Publick his Commentaries ſo polite, and ſo worthy of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Age, upon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Rhetorick and Logick. He alſo made Verſes, whoſe Character is ſo ſoft and melting, that they wou'd never have been taken to have been Writ in the bitter Climate of <hi>Friezland,</hi> where <hi>Agricola</hi> dwelt; and thoſe of the <hi>Triumph of Love over Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> made him known to the Elector <hi>Palatine.</hi> This Prince having got a Fancy, as well as <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> to form a Library out of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53621:177"/>the Ruins of thoſe the <hi>Turks</hi> had ravag'd in <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> and other the Neighbouring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, prevail'd with <hi>Agricola</hi> to repair to <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> the Capital City of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, gave him the firſt Chair for Eloquence in the Univerſity there Erected, and made him his Counſellour of State. But <hi>Agricola</hi> was not yet well inſtall'd in his new Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, when a Maligne Feavour ſnatcht him away in the flower of his Age, and depriv'd <hi>Germany</hi> of the only Man, it could confront to ſo many <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> whoſe Eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies I here make.</p>
            <p>We muſt render this Teſtimony to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Genius of <hi>Leo Battiſti Alberti,</hi> that never Man labour'd with more ſucceſs than he, upon ſo tireſome and ſo difficult a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. His Family, being of the moſt Illuſtrious of <hi>Florence,</hi> and ally'd to that of <hi>Medici,</hi> wrought the firſt tye of Friendſhip he had with <hi>Lorenzo:</hi> he communicated to him the Deſign he had conceiv'd of ſtudying the ancient Architecture, and received from him the Counſels and Aſſiſtance, that he needed in an Affair which requir'd much Recommendation. And indeed, <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi>'s Letters gave him acceſs at the Courts of all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> where there were old Ruines of Buildings which ſeem'd to have been Magnificent.

On which account, he reſolv'd to render that Author more Intelligible, and make him ſpeak in his own Tongue. He atchiev'd theſe two things with ſo much Order and Clearneſs, that the Learned had reaſon to ſay, after having ſcann'd the Work he had undertaken, that thoſe who ſhould read it, would become a skillful and expert, as he himſelf. Then he bent his Studies to Opticks, as perceiving that the Painters of his time, did not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in making Pourtraicts in Miniature.

               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:53621:179"/>Natural Hiſtory was compil'd, did averr it requir'd twice as much pains to reſtore it; nay, and after that too, they deſpair'd of Succeſs. However <hi>Hermolaus</hi> effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in a few years. In his Corrections he only made uſe of the Authority of Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts all along, where good Senſe cou'd ſubſiſt with retaining them; and when thoſe Manuſcripts were not ſufficient, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Authors, who had writ upon the ſame matters, and reſtor'd his <hi>Pliny</hi> upon their Credit. Laſtly, in ſuch places where thoſe two Succours faild him, he put in uſe his own Conjectures, with ſo much probability and happineſs, that not one of them was gain-ſay'd. By this ingenuous way did he diſcover, that the ſame <hi>Pliny</hi> was born at <hi>Coſme,</hi> and that he compos'd a Diſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on it, which Convinc'd all thoſe who read it. The Applauſes <hi>Hermolaus</hi> receiv'd on this occaſion, made him not have the better opinion of his ſufficiency; and they only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated him to continue to ſerve the Publick. He daily ſaw that the Medicinal Art was ill practis'd, becauſe two or three Men only in <hi>Italy</hi> were paſſibly inſtructed in the nature of Medicaments, and the admirable deſire he had to remedy the defect, made him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to do with <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> the ſame thing he had atchiev'd upon <hi>Pliny.</hi> And as his
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:53621:180"/>Talent was as large at furbiſhing up the <hi>Greek,</hi> as <hi>Latin</hi> Authors, he had alſo the ſame ſucceſs. Now after this, there ſeem'd nothing more left for him to do, than enjoy, bask, and acquieſce in the honour he had acquir'd. And his Friends invited him ſo to do, when he urg'd to them on his own accord, that it was no longer juſt, that <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> ſhou'd be intirely indebted to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> expell'd by the <hi>Turks,</hi> for the moſt ſolid Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, by their Traductions of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi> He added, that whatever pains had been taken, to render thoſe two Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors intelligible, principally the laſt, yet he was ſo little to be underſtood, that the Books of <hi>Rhetorick, Logick,</hi> and <hi>Phyſick</hi> were not of any uſe. That <hi>Themiſtius</hi> was the Man, of the Ancients, that had interpreted them with moſt Judgment and Neatneſs, but had not been better treated, than <hi>Pliny</hi> by the Copiers: that it was needful to ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout purging him of their faults, and make him ſpeak <hi>Latin,</hi> ſo to ſhrift under his Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance into all the Secrets of the <hi>Licoeum,</hi> and then take a more honourable Repoſe, by placing himſelf at the end of the Carriere, after having open'd to others, thoſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in <hi>Pliny,</hi> of Simples in <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> and of Ratiocination, in <hi>Themiſtius. Hermolaus</hi> accompliſh'd it, according as he had propos'd
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:53621:180"/>it, and <hi>Themiſtius</hi> appear'd with ſo much Pleaſingneſs and Majeſty, that none have ſince dar'd to retouch the Work. The Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators Reputation became then ſo great at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> his abode at that time, that Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 8th, being one day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, that the Patriarchſhip of <hi>Aquileia</hi> was fall'n vacant, he conferr'd it on him with full Right. It is to be preſum'd, his Holineſs had then no other Intentions, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the extraordinary Merit of <hi>Hermolaus.</hi> But the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> was too much upon its Guard, againſt the Innovations of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to want taking notice, that the Pope had made an Encroachment, by Conferring the Patriarchſhip of <hi>Aquileia:</hi> For tho' the Soveraign Pontiffs pretended, that they might place in that Station whom they pleas'd; yet they never did ſo with that Soveraign Authority, and were wont to give Bulls only to the Perſon nominated to them by the Ambaſſadour of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. Nevertheleſs, <hi>Innocent</hi> the 8th had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſed himſelf from keeping this Formality, in the affair in hand, and gave but too much room for ſuſpition to People, naturally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful, that he had nick'd his time to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Patriarch of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> a Patriarch and a Perſonage ſo famous, that they wou'd be far from oppoſing his Inſtallation, for the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:53621:181"/>placing there afterwards Parties, as wou'd not be of the ſame Conſideration. From hence it came to paſs, that tho' <hi>Hermolaus</hi> was one of the moſt Illuſtrious Gentlemen of <hi>Venice,</hi> and poſſeſs'd beſides all the other Qualities, that in another Conjuncture wou'd have preferr'd him to the Patriarchſhip; yet the Senate acted with as much Rigour and Obſtinacy, to hinder his attaining it, as if they had judg'd him abſolutely unworthy of it. On the other ſide, the Pope was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to maintain what he had done, and to carry things to extremity, rather than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that <hi>Hermolaus</hi> ſhou'd not enjoy the Grace he had done him. But this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Genius did his Common-wealth Juſtice, in oppoſition to his own Intereſts, and own'd ſhe had reaſon to be againſt him. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd the Pope to confer the Benefice on the Party that ſhou'd be preſented to him by the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Venice,</hi> and formally declar'd, that he wou'd accept none, if he muſt incur (at this rate) the Envy of his fellow Citizens. The Pope was ſo affected with his moderation, that he promis'd to make him Cardinal at the firſt Promotion. But in a few days after <hi>Hermolaus</hi> fell ſick of a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilential Feaver; the only remedy to Cure him, was giving him <hi>Bezoar,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mixt, nor ſophiſticated. There was
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:53621:181"/>ſome at <hi>Florence,</hi> in an <hi>Agate</hi> Veſſel, which <hi>Suldan Cayte-bay</hi> had made a Preſent of to <hi>Lorenzo de Medici, Politian,</hi> and <hi>Picodella Mirandola,</hi> ſent it Poſt, but the Courier found <hi>Hermolaus</hi> juſt expir'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Giorgio Merula,</hi> who ſurviv'd <hi>Hermolaus.</hi> but four days, had not a Wit ſo well turn'd as his, tho' little leſs Vigorous. He was a <hi>Lombard</hi> by Inclination, as well as by Birth, and thoſe who knew him intimately, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in him all the Vices, and all the Virtues attributed to that Nation. He was Maligne, unapt to Learn, Revengeful, Pittileſs; and if he did no miſchief, ſave by Writing, it was, becauſe that the lowneſs of his Fortune, and the Employment he follow'd, did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to do it in any other manner. He held it for an Honour to paſs for a Pedant; he affected all the Grimaces of Pedantry, for fear he ſhould be diſputed that Quality. All his Life long did he perform the Publick Functions of a Pedant at <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Milan.</hi> As his main ſtrength conſiſted in Criticiſme, he retrench'd his Wit to that, with it to gore and perſecute all the Learned Perſons of his Age. He was ever at War with one or other, and ſo implacable, that he wou'd never be reconcil'd with any Body. He had alſo this property of the Mad-dog, which he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for his Deviſe, that his bite was incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:53621:182"/>
               <hi>Calderin</hi> was the firſt, whoſe Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he took a pleaſure in ruining, not that he deſir'd to gain by it, but only, becauſe it ſeem'd too well ſettl'd to his Fancy. Then fell he to making an <hi>Index</hi> of the Errors he had found in <hi>Galcote,</hi> and us'd him ſo ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he took pet, and dy'd. Theſe two advantages, gain'd in the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar Combat, puft up his Heart. He took up all the able men in <hi>Europe,</hi> and publiſh'd againſt them his Corrections, which were read with ſo much the more avidity, that of ſo many Perſons, whoſe Ignorance was mark'd, there was not one durſt ſet Pen to Paper in his own Vindication, out of fear of being cruſht with a Reply. <hi>Merula</hi> did not ſo much as ſpare <hi>Politian,</hi> tho' <hi>Politian</hi> had acquir'd Fame ſufficient, as not to have his match. He ſhew'd him, that tho' Nature had given him all the qualities requiſite to become Learned, ſhe had not however been able to render him ſo. He noted to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirty egregious faults, that had ſtarted from him, and hinted to him charitably (ſaid he) that out of a deſire to paſs for the firſt, in the Republick of Letters, he muſt have read more, and ſtudy'd more than all the reſt together. <hi>Ludovico Sforza</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd at his having ſo formidable a Subject in his Colledge of <hi>Milan,</hi> made a ſcruple of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:53621:182"/>him any longer in Correcting of Children, and drew him out of the Duſt, to cauſe him to compile the Hiſtory of <hi>Milan.</hi> But it was only to leave to Poſterity a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Example, that the being very Learned, and perceiving the leaſt Faults and Blunders of others, was not ſufficient to make a good Hiſtorian: For tho' <hi>Merula</hi> has wrote with ſo much exactneſs and precaution, the Work preſcrib'd him, that the greateſt Critick cou'd not find any thing in it to carp at; yet true it is, that his Book is ſo dry and barren, that thoſe to whom the Authors Fame had given an itching to read it, ſeldom but grutch'd the time they had ſpent in that amuzement. This did not hinder him from being magnificently rewarded; but as he was near ninety years of Age, when he had finiſht it, none but his Heirs gain'd by the benefit that accru'd from his Performance. <hi>Politian</hi> was the Man that got moſt by his Death. He had publiſh'd the firſt Century of his Miſcellanies; and <hi>Merula</hi> being ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd at the audaciouſneſs, which ſeem'd to be in the word <hi>Century,</hi> had threatned <hi>Politian</hi> to detach againſt him whole Regiments of Authorities and Paſſages, to juſtifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of all he aſſerted, but had only the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to rough-draw the Project.</p>
            <p>Never Man came to be ſo admir'd for his
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:53621:183"/>Wit, in ſo green a Youth, as <hi>Angelius Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus;</hi> and never Man knew better how to preſerve, by juſt and unjuſt ways, the Reputation he had acquir'd. He was born at <hi>Florence,</hi> and his Relations liv'd in ſuch woful Poverty, as conſtrain'd him to be of <hi>Giuliano</hi>'s, and <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, when they went to the Colledge, and to wear their Liveries, that he might have the conveniency of being there. He had an ugly Face, a huge big and long Noſe, his left Eye ſquinted; but he had a pliant and flexible Wit, and was finely and craftily Ambitious. He never us'd ſo much Artifice to diſguiſe himſelf, ſave only with thoſe he had moſt Communication: He never heard any thing with ſo much Indignation, as the Praiſes of others: he was equally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious of his Friends and of his Enemies. No other Pen compos'd any thing to his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; he lov'd not to receive Correction, tho' he did it importunately to all ſorts of Perſons. It was ſometimes ſeen that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his Faults, and that it was meerly out of Malice, he reſiſted Truth. Yet he never own'd to have blunder'd. As to his way of living, it was ſo corrupted, that Modeſty hinders me from ſpeaking of it. What I mean, will be but too well divined by the Knowledge of his Death,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:53621:183"/>which I cannot ſteal from my Reader, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was too publick. Yet after all this, he had ſo marvellous a Genius, that the World has not ſeen the like ſince <hi>Ovid.</hi> At twelve years old he compil'd ſuch ſtately Verſes, that a body wou'd have ſaid they were of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Age, or of that of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus.</hi> And when the fancy took him to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the Learned, and make his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions paſs for Fragments of <hi>Anacreon,</hi> or of <hi>Catullus,</hi> which he had juſt found by chance, in ſome old Manuſcripts of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici</hi>'s Library, thoſe who beſt underſtood theſe matters, were impos'd on in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. His firſt famous piece was for <hi>Giuliano de Medici.</hi> This young Lord had won the prize of a Turnament, and lay queſting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Panegyrick, not inſeriour to <hi>Luca Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi</hi>'s, who had ſignaliz'd himſelf in the like occaſion, to the advantage of <hi>Lorenzo. Politian</hi> undertook the Province, and having perceiv'd that <hi>Pulſi</hi>'s Poem was not all along of the ſame Force, through the Authors having only couch'd in it things purely of his own Invention; he fancy'd he needed only (to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void this inequality) take a quite oppoſite Method. He Book-padded the ancient Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyricks of the nobleſt thoughts that ſuited with his Subject. He traveſty'd them after his own manner, and enchaſing them with
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:53621:184"/>ſuch Paſſages of Poetry, where he was not ſatisfy'd with his own Product; he made ſo fine a piece, that <hi>Pulſi,</hi> after having read it, wou'd have ſuppreſs'd his own, out of ſhame and vexation. The ſame <hi>Giuliano</hi> having been kill'd in the <hi>Pazzi</hi>'s Conſpiracy, <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> lying perdue for an extraordinary occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſhew he writ as well in Proſe as in Verſe, drew up ſo Pathetick a Deſcription of this Conſpiracy, that the Learned, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in the Library <hi>de Medici,</hi> avow'd that <hi>Cicero</hi> cou'd have done nothing better. After theſe two Eſſays, the high opinion <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litianus</hi> had of his Abilities, made him fall to intriguing for the Profeſſion of the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Eloquence. At the ſame time he became the Concurrent of <hi>Demotrius Calchon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile,</hi> and top'd him, by having a more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Accent, and by ſtrewing his Diſcourſe with Points, and bloomy, flouriſhing Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſo to recreate his Auditory. Above five hundred young Gentlemen, of all Countries in <hi>Europe,</hi> went to fetch him eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning in his own Houſe, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him, out of Honour, to the very Hall where he taught, and re-conducted him in like manner, when he deſcended the Chair. Theſe Deferences gave him ſo whimſical an Opinion of his parts, that he fancy'd, to keep up ſo great a Reputation, he muſt ſet about
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:53621:184"/>more ſolid Works, than Verſes, or Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or at leaſt amuſe the World with the expectation of ſome great Labour, and yet do nothing all the while. For this reaſon did he ſpend five whole years, without giving the Publick ought elſe than Leſſons. But at length the itch of Writing prevailing over his firſt deſign, he caus'd a Traduction of <hi>Herodian</hi> to be Printed, which had not all the effect he pretended: For tho' it was generally admir'd, a rumour was buz'd about, that <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litian</hi> had found it among the Papers of the famous <hi>Gregorio de Citta di Caſtello,</hi> which he had bought; and this report was grounded on ſuch Conjectures, as were but faintly deſtroy'd. Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> who was then under <hi>Politian,</hi> and heard all that was ſaid <hi>Pro.</hi> and <hi>Con</hi> at his Fathers Table, being deſir'd twenty years after, by the <hi>Academicks</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> to tell them his Sentiments in the Caſe, left the thing in ſuſpence, and undecided, and agreed, that the ſtile of that Tranſlation, had nothing like to that of <hi>Politian</hi>'s other works, and held more of the Paint, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, and Luxuriancy, which <hi>Gregorio de Citta di Caſtello</hi> was wont to uſe in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions: He added however (as if he had been afraid of having ſaid too much) that this <hi>Gregorio</hi> had done nothing comparable to this Verſion of <hi>Herodian.</hi> Be it as it will,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:53621:185"/>the work is ſo finiſht and compleat, tho' in ſome places it's too ſpruce, and over abounds with finical trappings, that none have yet dar'd to decide which is the beſt tranſlated, <hi>Polybius,</hi> or <hi>Herodian. Politian,</hi> a Man extraordinary nice, in matters of Honour, ſpar'd nothing of what might hinder him from paſſing for a Plagiary. He publiſh'd his Miſcellanies and his Poetries: and as he was happy and perſuaſive, he wou'd, perchance, have effected it, but for Death, which lopt him off at forty two years of Age. The Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal paſſion he had for one of his Scholars of high Quality, not being to be ſatisfy'd, it caſt him into a burning Fever. In the violence of the fit, he made a Song for the Object wherewith he was Charm'd, got out of Bed, took a Lute, with ſo tender and piteous an Air, that he expir'd in finiſhing the ſecond Couplet, the ſame day that <hi>Charles</hi> the 8th paſt the <hi>Alps</hi> in his way to the Conqueſt of <hi>Naples.</hi>

I lay a much greater ſtreſs upon a Conjecture, which came into my mind, upon reading his Apology; that it might be the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Judicial, very rife at that time, having made their advantage of ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in his <hi>Theſes,</hi> ſeemingly in their

Be it as it will, the Allarm this gave them, was ſo hot, that they aſſembled to reſolve what courſe they had beſt to take. They calculated the Prince of <hi>Mirandola</hi>'s Nativity, and found two remarkable things. The one, that he ſhou'd not put the laſt hand to his work againſt them; and the other, that he ſhou'd not exceed thirty two years of Age. They ſent to ſignifie this doom to him, at which he made a mock. But the event juſtify'd their Prediction: for as this Prince was compleating to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine the Foundations of their Science, he was ſeiz'd with a Fever, which knock'd him off in thirty days ſpace. It has been obſerv'd, that he breath'd his laſt in the very moment that <hi>Charles</hi> the 8th. en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>Florence;</hi> and that the Library <hi>de Medici</hi> was diſſipated, as if hazzard had taken him out of the World, in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, when he was going to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reav'd of the Originals of the Ancients, without which he could not live.

            <head>THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE HOUSE OF MEDICIS. The Fifth Book.</head>
            <p>ALL the <hi>Italian</hi> Hiſtorians of the laſt Century ſuppoſe, that <hi>Piero de Medici</hi>'s imprudence undermin'd all the Foundations laid by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, for the aggrandizement of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. But none have yet preciſely ſhown, wherein that Imprudence conſiſted, nor its
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:53621:189"/>Reſults and Conſequences. I undertake the repreſenting them here in order; and for my being the better underſtood, I begin with the Pourtraict of him, whoſe Errors I mean to deſcribe.</p>
            <p>Never did Son reſemble leſs his Father, than <hi>Piero de Medici,</hi> and never Father had ſo much Antipathy for a Child, as <hi>Loren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi> had for <hi>Piero.</hi> It ſeem'd as if Nature had only form'd the one for the other, to ſet her ſelf at odds, by a diviſion of her Provinces, and to inveſt two contrary Objects with all her Virtues and Vices, without giving any thing to the Son, of what ſhe had put into the Father. <hi>Piero de Medici</hi> poſſeſſed all the qualities wanting in <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> but had not ſo much as one of thoſe in him admir'd. His Body was incomparably well made, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the fineſt Head that had been ever ſeen. He was of ſo ſtrong and ſound a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, that not any exceſs was capable of ſtaggering it. So much ſtrength had he at ſeventeen years of Age, that not a Man was there, but whom he flung in wraſtling. He was extraordinarily expert and clever in all Exerciſes, ſerving to faſhion young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. His meen was altogether Martial, when he appear'd arm'd at all points; and the Judges of the Turnaments own'd, no Man knew how to break a Lance with a better Grace than <hi>Piero.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="293" facs="tcp:53621:189"/>
            <p>His Wit was vaſt and piercing, but ſo ill turn'd, he cou'd not uſe it to advantage. Nor capable was he of Friendſhip, nor of Secreſie; had no application but to Pleaſures, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of good humour in Hunting and with La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. The time ſpent in concernments of the Republick, he reputed as loſt, and went not to the Council, ſave when he had no ſhift left to diſpenſe him from going. He neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the Complaints made him againſt the Subalternate Magiſtrates, and thought it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to have an Eye to their Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Friends of his Houſe could not get admittance to his Speech, till after having a long while danc'd attendance in his Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, that their Zeal had had the leiſure to chill, and other Citizens of <hi>Florence</hi> cou'd have no acceſs to his Perſon. It ſpighted him infinitely, when People diſcours'd him upon the Modeſty of his Anceſtors. He ridicul'd their Oeconomy, principally in what regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Table. Inſupportable was his Pride in a Town, where all the Gentlemen thought themſelves one anothers equals. And his Luxury came to ſeem the more exorbitant, when compar'd with his Fathers and Great Grand-fathers Thrift, and good Husbandry. His Anger no leſs ſudden, nor leſs dangerous, than that of <hi>Alexander;</hi> for inſtance, poor <hi>Leoni,</hi> whom, at <hi>Careggio,</hi> he threw into
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:53621:190"/>the Well; but with more eaſe appeas'd, ſince there needed no more for the putting him into a good humour, than a Song or Lay of Muſick, or the Sound of ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Inſtruments. His Tutor, <hi>Politian,</hi> had obſerv'd him never to be troubled with Splenatick Humours, as long as he heard good Verſes recited in his Native Tongue; and to derive advantage from this obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a ſort of Diurnal Academy was held a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Piero de Medici</hi> found himſelf encharg'd with the principal Direction of the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Affairs, and remain'd not long in that Capacity, which ſerv'd for as many ſteps to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> help him to deſcend into the Precipice.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, he had got a fancy of making Love to all the fair Women of Quality, and was ſo little diſcreet and moderate in the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous viſits he paid their Ladiſhips, that their Husbands, and his Friends were almoſt equally ſcandaliz'd.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, His Mother, of the Lineage of the <hi>Orſini</hi>'s, thinking it convenient to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him, ſo with Matrimony to extinguiſh his fickle Flames, ſhe propos'd to him a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:53621:190"/>and rich Heireſs of the ſtock of <hi>Orſini,</hi> call'd <hi>Alfonſina,</hi> whom he wedded; but had as much diſguſt for her, in a few weeks after his Marriage, as he had ſhown fondneſs for the Match. The firſt time he ſaw her, he us'd her ſo ſcurvily, that he was hated for it by all his own People, who could not (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſentment) ſee him renew his Libertine way of Living, from which they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to tye him by this Wedlock.</p>
            <p>The third Fault was, That for ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of a double meaning, which ſcap'd from two of his Couſins, call'd <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> and <hi>Giovanni de Medici,</hi> whom it behov'd him ſo much the more to have conſider'd, in that they deſcended from Male to Male, from a Brother of <hi>Coſmo</hi> the Old; he caus'd them to be chaſtis'd with a perpetual Baniſhment, however great his Intereſt was in their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and whatever Remonſtrances his Friends had made him upon ſo nice a Subject. From whence it came, that theſe young Gentlemen being retir'd into <hi>France,</hi> were kindly welcom'd at the Court of <hi>Charles</hi> the 8th, where they ſo ſtrongly prepoſſeſs'd Cardinal <hi>Briſſonet,</hi> and other the Miniſters, to <hi>Piero de Medici</hi>'s diſadvantage, that when he went to this Prince, the Perſons nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to negociate with him, did in no wiſe credit his Propoſals and Aſſeverations, nor
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:53621:191"/>wou'd they truſt him, but under good Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which occaſion'd his Diſgrace.</p>
            <p>The fourth Fault was, that <hi>Piero de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici</hi> had ſo good an Opinion of his Wit, as to fancy, he might cully <hi>Lodovico Sforza,</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> who cully'd all Mankind. <hi>Sforza,</hi> after having ſeiz'd the State and Perſon of the young Duke, under colour of Tuition, thought an high Alliance needful to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him in his Uſurpation. The Princeſs <hi>Iſabella</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> ſeem'd to him fitteſt for his deſign, not only on the ſcore of all the Houſe of <hi>Arragon</hi>'s ſupport, at that time ſtrictly combin'd, but becauſe this Princeſs had the blaze of the moſt accompliſh'd Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all <hi>Europe.</hi> But an Obſtacle there was to ſurmount, which ſeem'd invincible; for that young Princeſs had been ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to the young Duke of <hi>Milan, Lodovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co Sforza</hi>'s Nephew, from whence he had in view, that beſides the Breach of word, to which the Houſe of <hi>Naples</hi> wou'd hardly be induc'd, it muſt likewiſe be brought to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that the Princeſs ſhou'd marry a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, after having been promis'd to a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, to which, it was well known, the high Spirit of that Houſe wou'd in no wiſe ſuffer it to hearken.</p>
            <p>Not but that <hi>Lodovico Sforza</hi> did himſelf ſufficiently manifeſt in his Diſcourſe, that
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:53621:191"/>he meant ſuddenly to be Duke, and already projected in his mind, the poyſoning of his Nephew, which he ſince committed, when the Armies of <hi>France</hi> had aſſur'd him of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity. But in ſhort, the thing was not yet effected, either that the occaſion ſerv'd not yet, or that he had ſtill left in his Heart ſome natural tenderneſs to ſurmount. Moreover, were the Crime committed, ſuch a Courſe was ſo ſtrange and novel among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> already much hated, wou'd not have dar'd to give his Daughter to a Man ſuſpected of ſuch an Action; and <hi>Lodovico Sforza</hi> well perceiving that he wou'd ſtand aloof from the ſame Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance he muſt Court by this ſtep, ſo of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to be made for its attainment.</p>
            <p>However, as Ambition finds nothing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, when tun'd to the key of Love; <hi>Sforza</hi> ſent his Confident <hi>Galeazzo da ſan Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verino</hi> to <hi>Naples</hi> to negotiate under-hand, that the Princeſs might be granted him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cant of the Duke his Nephew's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ill, that he cou'd live but little longer.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Naples</hi> had an extream repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to this Alliance, and yet wou'd have been brought to a Compliance, as labouring under a great dread of <hi>Sforza</hi>'s Artifices, if it had not been oppos'd by the Duke of <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria,</hi>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:53621:192"/>his Eldeſt Son, a man of leſs Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and more Courage than Old <hi>Ferrand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> It has been believ'd, that this was upon the Princeſs <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s Solicitation, who, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her Device, was no leſs Lofty than Beautiful.

            <p>

He was contriving the means to exclude the Duke of <hi>Calabria's</hi> Succeſſion to the Crown of <hi>Naples,</hi> and found not out any other way, than to make him the Conqueſt of <hi>Charles</hi> the 8th.

            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> made ſome difficulty at firſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, as not having Friends enow in <hi>Italy;</hi> and <hi>Sforza,</hi> after having taken upon him
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:53621:192"/>to Conduct in all ſafety its Armies, as far as the Territory of <hi>Florence,</hi> made the Council of <hi>France</hi> hope he wou'd attract <hi>Piero de Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci</hi> into the moſt Chriſtian King's Intereſts. This was no eaſie matter to effect, ſeeing the <hi>Florentines</hi> had, a little time afore, ſign'd a League with the Pope, and the Houſe of <hi>Arragon.</hi> But the ſame <hi>Galeazza da ſan Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verino,</hi> of whom I have already ſpoken, had orders to endeavour to break it. He accoſted <hi>Piero de Medici,</hi> who cou'd not fail of repartying; that when the <hi>French</hi> King was Maſter of <hi>Naples,</hi> it wou'd be eaſie for him to ſubdue the reſt of <hi>Italy. Galeazzo,</hi> whom <hi>Sforza</hi> had commanded to break his mind to <hi>Piero de Medici,</hi> took him aſide, and diſclos'd to him in Confidence, and under the Roſe, that his Maſters Deſign was indeed, that the <hi>French</hi> ſhou'd come into <hi>Italy,</hi> but not there to ſtay; that he knew how to ſend them packing beyond the <hi>Alpes,</hi> after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made them his Implements to humble the Duke of <hi>Calabria. Piero de Medici,</hi> not being capable of keeping ſo great a Secret, reveal'd it to ſo many Perſons, that it came to <hi>Charles</hi> the 8th his Ears, and he made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Complaints to <hi>Sforza,</hi> who found no other way to purge himſelf, but by conſenting, that the <hi>French</hi> ſhou'd put Garriſons into all the Important places in their Paſſage. But
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:53621:193"/>in recompence, he conceiv'd an irreconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hatred to <hi>Piero de Medici.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while the <hi>French</hi> advanc'd, and as ſoon as they approached <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> they ſummon'd the <hi>Florentines</hi> to come to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration. <hi>Piero de Medici</hi> committed then a Fifth Fault, which I only glance upon, it being already regiſtred in Hiſtory. He went and put himſelf into their hands, and got not thence, till after having deliver'd up the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of <hi>Piſa, Leghorn, Seruzana,</hi> and <hi>Pietra Sculta.</hi> This fir'd the <hi>Florentines</hi> with ſo much Indignation, that one of them, <hi>Verli</hi> by name, ſhut the Door upon his Noſe, when he came to take his Seat in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. This Excluſion perſuaded him he was utterly loſt. Home went he, took Horſe, and without being follow'd by more than two of his Domeſticks, who cou'd not endure to ſee him go away alone, he departed <hi>Florence,</hi> and ſcour'd away to <hi>Bologna.</hi> So ſudde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and ſo ſhameful a retreat, quite diſcredited him with his Friends as well as Enemies. Both Fancy'd he muſt needs be more culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than they had imagin'd, and ſo have drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the utmoſt Puniſhments, ſince he fled away in a time when his Country needed moſt his Preſence. Upon this Prejudice, they paſs'd through all the Proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, that are wont to be exerted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:53621:193"/>Criminals; Arraign'd he was of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy, purſu'd, his Eſtate ſeiz'd, ſet to ſail by Publick Out-cry; they ſold at a low Price, that prodigious maſs of Moveables, Pictures, Anticks, and Manuſcripts Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the ſpace of ſev'nty years, with ſo much Pains and Curioſity. And by a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious effect, the Grandeur of the Houſe of <hi>Medici,</hi> never glitter'd more, than during the two or three Weeks it was giv'n up to Pillage.</p>
            <p>Said I have, that <hi>Piero de Medici</hi> had two Brothers, <hi>Giuliano,</hi> and <hi>Giovanni</hi> the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. <hi>Giuliano</hi> was in the Houſe, when the eldeſt departed thence, and accompany'd him; but the Cardinal being out upon a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, found more difficulty to make his eſcape. At firſt he thought to take refuge in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of St. <hi>Marco,</hi> built and founded by his Anceſtors, and lurk there till the ſtorm was over; but the Religious more timerous than grateful, declin'd, with Excuſes, giving him a retreat. Then he had recourſe to the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliers,</hi> who made him lay aſide the Purple, and clad him with one of their Habits, by favour of which, he paſs'd, without being known, through the Gate of St. <hi>Gal,</hi> and went to join his Brothers. The Houſe of <hi>Medici</hi> ſeem'd now ſo humbl'd, by ſo terrible a Squelch, that it cou'd not of a long time be
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:53621:194"/>poſſible for it to get up again. However, it was upon the point of being re-eſtabliſh'd, in a few days after this Diſaſter, if <hi>Piero de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici</hi> had not himſelf thwarted his own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, by a Caprice, which pawl'd Fortune in ſuch manner, that ſhe utterly turn'd tale, and never more wou'd ſhe ſtir in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> the 8th being inform'd of the Diſorder which happen'd in <hi>Florence,</hi> drew near it, and made his entrance into that Town, in the poſture of a Conquerour. <hi>Alfonſina degli Orſini</hi> laid her ſelf at the Kings Feet, holding in her Arms a Son of hers but lately born. Her Tears melted the Hearts of all preſent, and made her find Friends in a Court where ſhe was utterly unacquainted. Two perſons were there of the King's Attendants, who ſhared the Favour, the one in quality of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Miniſter, the other, as Favourite. Cardinal <hi>Briſſonet</hi> had the Province of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and poſſeſs'd his Maſters good Opinion, without ſeeking any other ſupport than his own Merit. And the Count <hi>de Breſſe,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Savoyes</hi> Brother, having more affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with the Age and Temperament of <hi>Charles,</hi> was one in all his Pleaſures, and lay at watch for a Conjuncture proper to ſupplant the Cardinal. He knew this Old Miniſter had declar'd an averſeneſs to <hi>Piero
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:53621:194"/>de Medici,</hi> and was prejudic'd with the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the King's Authority could not ſubſiſt at <hi>Florence,</hi> ſave during an equality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Citizens; that muſt be extinct when the Houſe of <hi>Medici</hi> ſhou'd be inveſted with Soveraign Power.</p>
            <p>To deſtroy this ſuppoſition, the Count <hi>de Breſſe</hi> (after having back'd his Deſign with a ſtrong Cabal) repreſented to the King, that as his Majeſty cou'd not ſtay at <hi>Florence,</hi> it became him to think of maintaining that City in his Party; that the ſafeſt and moſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious way was, not to leave there the Popular Government, then newly Erected, by reaſon it wou'd be expos'd to continual Seditions, not to be calm'd, ſave by a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Garriſon, which <hi>France</hi> was not then in a Condition to leave; that much better it wou'd be, to recall <hi>Piero de Medici,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtate him in Affairs with ſo good a Grace, as that he might owe to <hi>France</hi> the whole Obligation of his Reſtauration, ſince the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for ſo great a benefit, being united with the concern of Self-preſervation, wou'd link him in an inviolable Union with <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Reaſon had the Aſcendant, though neither ſolid nor ſpecious, for that the King did not then think ſo much of doing things ſafely, as of expediting them with the ſooneſt. A Courier was diſpatch'd away to <hi>Bologna,</hi>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:53621:195"/>to adviſe <hi>Piero de Medici</hi> to return to <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> but the Courier found him not. He had taken exception, for that <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> when he receiv'd him into his Palace, had blam'd him for being Bug-bear'd with his own Shadow, and for baniſhing himſelf from the beſt Station in <hi>Italy,</hi> without being puſh'd, or laying his hand to his Sword, he who pretended to ſo much Bravery. This Correction was unſeaſonable, and ſo much the more harſh to ſupport, as being conſcious of its being well grounded; but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him to pardon this Irregular Diſcourſe, in ſuch an impetuous and ſevere Man as <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivoglio,</hi> who fear'd the <hi>Bologneſi</hi> might unite after the <hi>Florentines</hi> Example, and conſtrain him in his turn, to ſeek out a retreat, in lieu of affording it to others.</p>
            <p>In the mean while <hi>Piero de Medici</hi> thought <hi>Bentivoglio</hi> had talkt thus out of Raillery, or to ſlurr upon him a Bravade And as Perſons in diſtreſs have more Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than ordinary, he ſuſpected he might be betray'd, ſince in his own Preſence he was turn'd into Deriſion. Hereupon he projected to ſeek out another place of ſafety, and departed on the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>w without ſaying whither he went. Inſomuch that the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier having neither been able to find him, nor get tydings of him; <hi>Charles</hi> being oppreſs'd
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:53621:195"/>to leave <hi>Florence,</hi> was oblig'd to leave it in the State he found it. Eight days after, <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ero de Medici</hi> was known to be at <hi>Venice,</hi> where <hi>Virginio Orſini,</hi> his Ally having brave Troops, treated with him for his re-inſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He advanc'd Courageouſly into the very ſight of <hi>Florence,</hi> but the Correſpondence he had in that place not keeping tack at the time prefixt, compell'd he was to return thence, after having advis'd <hi>Piero de Medici</hi> to take his meaſures better another time. This firſt Eſſay did for a long while diſhearten thoſe who were able to form others, and gave all the leaſure neceſſary to the Enemies of the Houſe of <hi>Medici,</hi> to put invincible Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to its re-eſtabliſhment. But as People are almoſt ever miſtaken in the choice of Men, when they do it in haſte; it happen'd that <hi>Bernardo Neri,</hi> whom the <hi>Florentines</hi> Elected for <hi>Gonfalioniere,</hi> was the moſt ardent and beſt intention'd of the <hi>Medici</hi>'s ſecret Friends. Nevertheleſs his Magiſtracy was continued for three years, but almoſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpent, without his finding any occaſion of doing them an Office, as being ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by <hi>Savanarola.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Religious of St. <hi>Dominick</hi> was very Learned, and the moſt knowing Man that had been in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſince the Age of the firſt <hi>Caeſars.</hi> He liv'd in great Auſterity, and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:53621:196"/>check'd Vices in all ſorts of Perſons, with a boldneſs, by ſome ſtyl'd Temerity. He had foretold ſo many extraordinary things, which falling out all in the Circumſtances he had noted, he paſs'd for a great Prophet: and the <hi>Florentines</hi> were ſo ſtrongly perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of his Sanctity, that they even Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd him, during his Life time His real and ſuppos'd Talents made him act in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> with as much Authority, as if he had been Soveraign, ſince they not only defer'd to his Counſels in Publick Aſſemblies, but he was moreover the Umpire of Domeſtick matters, and decided quarrels ariſing between Husbands and Wives, without there ever being any inexecution or complaint againſt his Deciſions and Decrees. He was prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd with the Opinion of the <hi>Florentines</hi> being more capable of the popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than of any other; and for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had he endeavour'd to ruine the Deſigns of the <hi>Medici,</hi> as ſeeing them addicted to confer the firſt Offices of the State, on the Principal and Richeſt Citizens, that ſo the People might be diſ-accuſtom'd from exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, and ſuffer 'em to enjoy them with the more eaſe, when they came to talon them with an Uſurpation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Savanarola</hi> bottom'd his Practices and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts upon the ſame Principles, by calling
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:53621:196"/>the vileſt Mechanicks to the moſt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Functions, nay, and in willing they ſhou'd officiate them with Gentlemen; I mean, that he thereby aim'd to take away the ancient Antipathy, reigning between the Nobility and the Populace. But hence aroſe two notable Inconveniences; the one, that Gentlemen, the moſt capable of exerciſing the Magiſtratures, laid them down, as ſoon as they had heard their Colleagues nam'd; the other, that Coblers, for Example, were daily ſeen to ſquat in their Stalls, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving laid aſide their Robe of Magiſtracy. This appear'd ſo ridiculous at firſt, and in proceſs of time, ſo very much ſpighted the ancient Nobility, that <hi>Neri</hi> found the Nobles almoſt wholly inclin'd to uphold their Rank.</p>
            <p>The firſt who unboſom'd their Intentions to him were, <hi>Giacomo Ridolphi, Lorenzo Tournaburni,</hi> and <hi>Giovanni Bueci.</hi> Others declar'd their Minds as occaſion ſerv'd; but there was not as yet the leaſt glimmering of ſucceſs for any attempt againſt <hi>Savanarola,</hi> as long as the People were on his ſide, and now this Emergency was expected wou'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave him of their Affection. The main Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of the <hi>Medici</hi> had ever been, that the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſhou'd never want either Bread or Divertiſements: and as they had neither an
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:53621:197"/>
               <hi>Aegypt</hi> nor a <hi>Sicily,</hi> to make largeſſes of Corn, in imitation of <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> they had retrench'd their Craft to effect, that the Grain ſhou'd coſt no more one year than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. For this purpoſe they took care to lay up Stores in Granaries, from whence they were fetch'd in time and place, when there had been many barren years together. They took out of the publick Treaſury, or their own Coffers, the ſurpluſage of what this Grain coſt; and when the Famine was general in <hi>Italy,</hi> and throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> they encharged their Factours in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> to buy up Corn at <hi>Cairo,</hi> and on the Coaſts of <hi>Barbary,</hi> to freight with it their Ships, and convey it ſafely into <hi>Tuſcany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As <hi>Savanarola</hi> was not in a Capacity to do the like, he felt the Counter blow upon the firſt ſcarcity that happen'd. His having Prophecy'd the want, avail'd him not in the leaſt; on the contrary, the <hi>Florentines</hi> took it ſo much the more in dudgeon, that he had us'd no remedy in the caſe. Many of the Mobile no longer ſhew'd ſo much Zeal for his Perſon, and others burſt out ſo far as to twit him, that he wou'd do better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in his Cloiſter, than be fumbling, groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and fribling in a way he did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. <hi>Neri,</hi> ſeeing the Diſpoſition he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, fram'd a Party, which ſeem'd ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:53621:197"/>ſtrong to re-inveſt the Houſe of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici.</hi> He gave <hi>Piero</hi> the neceſſary Intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and advis'd him to come with the moſt Troops he cou'd get together, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king much noiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Piero de Medici</hi> having not much Credit among the Souldiers, had recourſe to <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolomeo de Lalviano,</hi> newly acknowledg'd head of the Family of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini</hi>'s, upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of <hi>Virginio</hi>'s being poyſon'd in the Caſtle of <hi>Loeuf,</hi> at <hi>Naples. Lalviano,</hi> reputed the moſt active and determinate Adventurer of his Age, liſten'd to this Propoſition, and ſet about atchieving it. The day was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the time of Midnight choſen as the moſt Commodious. The Conſpirators con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed their Meaſures with <hi>Piero de Medici,</hi> and Secreſie was kept by all Parties. <hi>Lal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viano</hi>'s Souldiers us'd incredible expedition, and met at the Rendezvous, but four Leagues from <hi>Florence,</hi> with <hi>Piero de Medici,</hi> who ſet himſelf at their head. But in the very moment they began to file off in good Order, there fell ſo great a Rain, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the ſix hours they had reckon'd to accompliſh their March in, it coſt 'em twelve; ſo as it was already broad day when they came before the Town. They wou'd nevertheleſs have ſurpriz'd <hi>Florence,</hi> there being not the leaſt inckling of their
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:53621:198"/>Deſign, and that the Conſpirators were not wanting to keep the Gate, agreed on, open. But Chance alone fruſtrated their fore-ſight, <hi>Paulo Vitelli</hi> commanding the <hi>Florentine</hi>'s Army before <hi>Piſa,</hi> had wanted ſome Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and as it was an Affair of moment, he had thought his Preſence neceſſary, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure diſpatch. Being on his Journey, but delay'd by the bad Weather, he arriv'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly at the Gate, through which <hi>Lalviane</hi> and <hi>Piero de Medici</hi> were going to enter, when he heard behind him a Body of Horſe advancing full ſpeed. He loſt neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of mind, nor judgment; and ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what might poſſibly be the Deſign, he himſelf hall'd up the Bridge, ſhut the Gate, and gave the Allarm. The Citizens flock'd thither, and <hi>Savanarola,</hi> one of the firſt, they pointed the Canon againſt <hi>Lalviano</hi>'s Groſs, who judging, by the Countenance of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> that nothing was to be expected from the Faction in his Confederacy, he perſuaded <hi>Piero de Medici</hi> to a Retreat, both keeping in the Rear of their Men.</p>
            <p>For two Months together ſearch was made in vain, after the Authors of the Conſpiracy, nor had they been detected, but for one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Autelli,</hi> whoſe Audacity was ſo great, as to give up to the Magiſtrates, a Servant of
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:53621:198"/>
               <hi>Neri</hi>'s, without having any other Evidence, but his ſeeing him Arm'd, on the day <hi>Piero de Medici</hi> offer'd to enter. The Servant being taken into Cuſtody, had ſhew'd to him the Inſtruments of the Rack, told all he knew, and the principal Complices were impriſon'd. Their Indictment being drawn up, <hi>Savanarola</hi> too late perceiv'd the danger, in puniſhing ſo great a number of illuſtrious Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals. <hi>Franciſco Valeri</hi> had moſt concern in the Sentence, and proſecuted it with more heat than others. He was <hi>Savanarola</hi>'s beſt Friend, ſeconded him in all hardy Enterpriſes, had contributed to his gaining the repute of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; but, in recompence, ruin'd him, by refuſing to Sacrifice to the publick Good a petty Intereſt of Revenge. Now theſe are the Circumſtances I have been able to find out upon ſo delicate an Affair. I omit others, becauſe that, of ſo many Authors who ſpeak of <hi>Savanarola</hi>'s Cataſtrophe, there's not one but is prepoſſeſs'd with Paſſion for or againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valeri</hi> was <hi>Neri</hi>'s mortal Enemy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to ruin him at any rate. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture for the bringing it about cou'd not be more propitious. <hi>Neri</hi> was convicted of the Conſpiracy; but, not with any Face, cou'd they puniſh him ſingly, ſeeing he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd no more culpable than his Complices,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:53621:199"/>wherefore they were all to be Condemn'd to the ſame Puniſhment, or Pardon'd; and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanarola,</hi> contrary to Cuſtom, was of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they ought to be Repriev'd. He conjur'd <hi>Valeri</hi> that it might be ſo; remonſtrated to him the Conſequence, repreſenting that all the other Criminals were either his Allies or Friends. But this Bloody minded Man, meerly out of the Pleaſure he ſhou'd take in <hi>Neri</hi>'s Puniſhment, had regard nor to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon nor to Amity. The Sentence of Death was pronounc'd, and never, in a ſmall State, were there ſeen more Eminent Perſons Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in one day.</p>
            <p>This rejoyc'd the People at firſt; and at long run, as is uſual, turn'd 'em tender and compaſſionate. So many re-doubled Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions created a Horrour in them; they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd <hi>Savanarola</hi> of the Butchery. And the Nobles not thinking their own Power ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ruin that Religious, without hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Government, engaged the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> for its own Intereſts, to ſecond their Endeavours. <hi>Savanarola</hi> had Preach'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Vices of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 6th, with the ſame Freedom he us'd in ſnubbing and rebuking thoſe of private Perſons. Had added, in the heat of his Diſcourſe, how he was not afraid of being Excommunicated for ſpeaking in this manner; and that it was
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:53621:199"/>ſufficient to give his Enemies the pretext they had ſo long expected, to ſeize his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as not believing that the Head of the Church, cou'd retrench a ſimple Monk from the Communion of the Church. They took their meaſures with the Pope, who ſent them Forces. <hi>Savanarola</hi>'s Monaſtery was broke open, after a wonderful reſiſtance of his Friends, who ran in upon the noiſe. He was found in his Chamber at the Feet of a Crucifix, put into Priſon, ſev'n whole days ſpent in taking Informations, examining his Caſe, and drawing up his Indictment, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which, he made a Commentary upon the Pſalms of Penitence, which the moſt hardned cannot read, without ſome ſenſe of Devotion. At laſt he was Condemn'd to the Flames, which he ſuffer'd with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy ſeemingly Chriſtian. <hi>Valeri,</hi> the Author of his ruin, meerly to gratifie his Luſt of Revenge, was neither tunning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, nor diligent enough to make his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape. Thoſe who went to inveſt his Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, met him coming out, aſſaſſinated him, ran up to his Wife's apartment, ſerv'd her in like manner, and plunder'd the Houſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Florentines</hi> were no better enclin'd, in regard of the <hi>Medici;</hi> on the contrary, the averſion of <hi>Savanarola</hi>'s Friends, who charg'd the <hi>Medici</hi>'s with his Death, induc'd
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:53621:200"/>the <hi>Florentines</hi> to redouble and produce new Obſtacles to their return. <hi>Giuliano de Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci</hi> had taken refuge at <hi>Milan,</hi> where he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd <hi>Lodovico Sforza</hi>'s Friendſhip, and had engag'd him to eſpouſe the Intereſts of his Houſe. The Army <hi>Sforza</hi> had on foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to act in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> on that Deſign, with much Vigour and Succeſs, when the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> unmask'd their Intentions a little too ſoon, as to the Treaty they manag'd under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with the Inhabitants of <hi>Piſa,</hi> in order to receive their Hommage, on condition to cauſe the Siege of their Town to be rais'd, which the <hi>Florentines</hi> had then two years continued.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sforza</hi> had no ſooner the news, but he conceiv'd a jealouſie: and the aggrandiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whom he look'd on as his moſt formidable Adverſaries, made him change Conduct towards the <hi>Medici</hi>'s. He ſent one of his Emiſſaries to the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> to re-unite them among themſelves; and his Forces, which laid <hi>Tuſcany</hi> waſte, had Orders to join thoſe of <hi>Vitelli,</hi> and to preſs the Siege of <hi>Piſa.</hi> They help'd that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to ruin the Army of <hi>Venice,</hi> that had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly hamper'd it ſelf in the <hi>Apennine,</hi> and were the principal cauſe of the Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation <hi>Hercules,</hi> Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> ſince ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiated, and concluded between the two
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:53621:200"/>Common-wealths, on Condition, that that of <hi>Venice,</hi> ſhou'd abandon the City and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of <hi>Piſa,</hi> to the diſcretion of that of <hi>Florence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Recoyl of this Accord falling on the Houſe of <hi>Medici,</hi> (becauſe it re-doubl'd the Forces of its Enemies) made it deſpond of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing re-inſtated. The Eldeſt of the three Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, after having exhauſted in the Fore-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Attempts, the effects his Father had left him out of <hi>Florence,</hi> was going to ſerve in quality of Volunteer, in the Troops of King <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12th, who meditated the Conqueſt of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan.</hi> His younger, <hi>Giuliano,</hi> of a humour more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, with-drew to the <hi>Petrucci</hi>'s, inveſted at that time with the principal Authority in <hi>Sienna,</hi> where he Couzen'd his time in Love and Gallantry. And the youngeſt taking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the Title of Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> (tho' it was as yet the Mode to call Cardinals by the Name of their Benefices) went to travel throughout <hi>Europe</hi> with <hi>Giulio</hi> his Cozen, as yet neither paſſing for a Baſtard nor Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, and a train of twelve Perſons. He put himſelf into the diſguiſe of a bare Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, to avoid Expence, and wou'd not ſuffer any difference to be obſerv'd between him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Attendants. They were all mounted and clad alike, had taken Warlike
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:53621:201"/>Names, and every morning drew Lots, who ſhou'd be own'd for head of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and give Orders that day. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct which they kept out of Precaution, furniſh'd them with ſo many occaſions for Mirth and Laughter, that the Cardinal ſince own'd, amid all the Delights of the Papacy, that in all his Life he had never been better Diverted, not but that new Traverſes befell him from time to time; for they were known in the City of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lme</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> from whence the Magiſtrate ſent them under a Safe guard, to the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> the 1ſt. But the Cardinal <hi>de Medici,</hi> having unvail'd his way of Travelling to that Prince, who ſtill entertain'd a Reſpect for the memory of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo,</hi> he was receiv'd magnificently by his Imperial Majeſty, and got Letters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation to <hi>Philip,</hi> Arch Duke of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> that he might ſee the more commodiouſly the ſeventeen Provinces.</p>
            <p>At his leaving of <hi>Flanders,</hi> he had a deſign to Embark at <hi>Calice,</hi> for <hi>England.</hi> But the Sea was ſo rough, that thoſe of his Train inclin'd him to ſee <hi>Normandy,</hi> till it was Calm again. As he was at <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> waiting for a Ship for his Paſſage, a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> having born Arms in <hi>Italy,</hi> knew him, and went to diſcover him to the Governour of the place. The Governour ſtopp'd him
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:53621:201"/>with all his Retinue, and clapt 'em under Guards. Nothing did it avail the Cardinal <hi>de Medici,</hi> to declare his Name, and demand to enjoy the Priviledges of his Character; ſtay he muſt in <hi>Havre,</hi> till the King, then at <hi>Milan,</hi> had conſented to his enlargement. <hi>Piero de Medici</hi> was happily with his Majeſty, and ſerv'd for Warantee of his Brothers having no other Deſign in his Maſquerade, than of Husbanding his Purſe.</p>
            <p>Thus the General of <hi>Normandy</hi> had order to write to the Governour of <hi>Havre,</hi> to ſet free the Cardinal <hi>de Medici,</hi> who chang'd his Purpoſe of going into <hi>England,</hi> and choſe rather to croſs <hi>France,</hi> in order to take Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at <hi>Thoulon,</hi> and make Sail into <hi>Italy.</hi> He ſaw all Curioſities on his way, and being ſeiz'd with a ſtorm in the River of <hi>Genoua,</hi> it conſtrain'd him to put in at <hi>Savona.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There he found the Cardinal of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in Bonds, who had made it his Sanctuary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 6th. his irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Enemy. St. <hi>Peter ad Vincula</hi> treated there his Brother, with all the Politeneſs natural to him, and wou'd needs have <hi>Giuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano de Medici,</hi> then beginning to wear the Croſs of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> to be the third at Table. There they diſcours'd their Concerns with more Freedom, and leſs Reſerve, than if they had known they were to be all three
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:53621:202"/>Popes, ſo little appearance was there of the viciſſitude which occurred in their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of attending upon the Pope, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Jubilee</hi> of the year 1500, juſt going to begin; but in reality, as having learnt that the Duke <hi>de Valentinois,</hi> the Pope's Son, had ſuch Deſigns, as cou'd not ſpeed, but by the re-inſtation of the <hi>Medici</hi>'s. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this Duke, after having oppreſs'd by an Infinity of unheard of Crimes, all the Petty Soveraigns in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbria</hi> and <hi>Romagna,</hi> aſpir'd to ſubdue the Republicks of <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> And not being Potent enough to undertake to force them all at once, he pretended to ſtrike up an Alliance with that of <hi>Florence,</hi> that ſhe might help him to ſubdue that of <hi>Sienna.</hi> However, there was no likelihood of bringing her to it by Offices and Perſuaſions, the <hi>Florentines</hi> being too ſubtle and ſagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, not to penetrate to what end they were to be Implements againſt <hi>Sienna.</hi> Thus they were to be induc'd to it out of Fear.</p>
            <p>This was the Cauſe of Duke <hi>Valentino</hi>'s receiving the <hi>Medici</hi>'s into his Army, with all imaginable Civilities, and of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them their re-inſtation. He drew near <hi>Florence</hi> with ſuch brisk Troops, as made it not doubted, but he wou'd reduce it to
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:53621:202"/>ſtrange Exigencies, when <hi>Piero de Soderini, Neri</hi>'s Succeſſor in the Office of <hi>Gonfalioniere,</hi> devis'd an Expedient which ſav'd his Country. He went to find out the Ambaſſadour of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and remonſtrated to him ſo efficaciouſly the moſt Chriſtian King's Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to maintain the popular Government at <hi>Florence,</hi> thereby to keep on Foot a League of Communication between the Realm of <hi>Naples,</hi> which his Majeſty meant to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, and the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> which he had already in Poſſeſſion, that the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour preſs'd the Pope, to make his Son retire into the ſtate of the Church.</p>
            <p>The Pope, not daring at that time to deny the <hi>French,</hi> they being then too powerful in <hi>Italy,</hi> wrote to the Duke <hi>de Valentinois</hi> to decamp from off the Territory of <hi>Florence,</hi> Duke <hi>Valentino</hi> obey'd, as ſeeing the <hi>French</hi> wou'd conſtrain him to it, unleſs he did it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and with alacrity. But as he was the craftieſt Man then living, he tore the Letter in pieces, without reading it out. He curſt his Father, and declar'd he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp. <hi>Soderini</hi> took the hint, and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that all the Grimaces of the Duke <hi>de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinois</hi> only tended to hedge in Money, which he durſt not demand for fear of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>France,</hi> which Crown wou'd have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd him to refund. Now to elude his
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:53621:203"/>Pretenſion, there needed no more than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſemblance of not underſtanding his meaning; but as the ſtay of his Troops did more dammage in four and twenty hours, than the ſum amounted to, with which he thought he wou'd be content; <hi>Soderini</hi> made no difficulty of offering it him, nor the Duke <hi>Valentinois</hi> of accepting it, and diſ-lodging.</p>
            <p>The following year, 1501, the <hi>Medici</hi>'s made their fourth Eſſay on this Pretext, that the <hi>Florentines</hi> had caus'd their General <hi>Vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li</hi> to be beheaded, becauſe that having clapt him up in Priſon on ſuſpition, found to be ill grounded, they fancy'd he was to be bereft of his Life, to hinder him from taking Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. <hi>Vitelli,</hi> his Brother, had put himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a poſture of puniſhing ſo black an Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and the Souldiers flock'd from all ſides to ſecond him. He brought an Army on foot, which wrought no leſs terror to the <hi>Florentine,</hi> than Duke <hi>Valentino</hi>'s had done the year afore. And indeed <hi>Soderini</hi> had no ſooner perceiv'd it, than that he took a journey into <hi>France,</hi> by which only the Tempeſt cou'd be laid. He obtain'd a Diſpatch to the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> whom <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12th commanded, to compell <hi>Vitelli</hi> inſtantly to diſarm, or march againſt him with all his Forces. <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telli</hi> having no Martialliz'd Troops, wou'd not ſtand the brunt, and ſo pleas'd the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines,</hi>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:53621:203"/>by his Retreat, that they Created <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derini</hi> perpetual Dictator.</p>
            <p>The vexation this Created to the Houſe of <hi>Medici,</hi> was ſo much the more reaſonable, as that <hi>Soderini</hi> poſſeſs'd all the qualities ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of obſtructing their return into their Country, as long as the continuation of his Magiſtracy. He was Wiſe, Liberal, Mild, and Provident; never committed any Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and though oblig'd to favour the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty, to whom he was indebted for his Dignity, he ſo carefully avoided diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Nobles, that not any Gentleman had reaſon to complain of him, during his Adminiſtration. He Correſponded with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the means of the Cardinal his Brother. But, as he put his principal Confidence in the Protection of the <hi>French,</hi> he liv'd in ſuch good Intelligence with the Cardinal <hi>d' Amboiſe,</hi> the Moſt Chriſtian King's Prime Miniſter, that there muſt of neceſſity have happen'd a general Revolt in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> afore the Republick of <hi>Florence</hi> cou'd change Face. Nevertheleſs, not only the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> was then ſecure, but moreover <hi>France</hi> had the moſt powerful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in <hi>Italy,</hi> that had been ſeen there for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ages, in order to take the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> from the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what plung'd the <hi>Medici</hi>'s quite in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:53621:204"/>was the misfortune which befell the <hi>Orſini</hi>'s, on their account. This Warlike Family had engag'd it ſelf to ſerve among the Troops, under Duke <hi>Valentino,</hi> after having fail'd re-inſtating that of <hi>Medici,</hi> its double Ally: and as this ill ſucceſs had diminiſh'd nothing of their Amity, the <hi>Orſini</hi>'s having diſcover'd, that their General treated with the <hi>Florentines,</hi> to deliver up <hi>Piero, Giuliano,</hi> and <hi>Cardinal de Medici,</hi> whom he had then in his Poſſeſſion and Power; they being all three come to him upon his Word. They gave them notice of it by a Note, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd them to withdraw without taking leave; Duke <hi>Valentino,</hi> who expended much in Spies, was at length inform'd of the Cauſe, which had hindred him from earning a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Crowns, that were already told out at <hi>Florence,</hi> in order to be giv'n him on that ſcore. And as he had reſolv'd, with the Conſent and Connivance of his Father, to exterminate the moſt eminent <hi>Roman</hi> Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, he haſten'd to invite the Members of the <hi>Orſini Clann,</hi> to the Feaſt of <hi>Senegaglia,</hi> where they were ſo ill advis'd as almoſt all to meet there, to periſh by a Perfidy well known to all the World.</p>
            <p>Their Deaths put the laſt hand to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining all the hopes <hi>Piero de Medici</hi> had left for his Reſtauration, and ſo flatted his
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:53621:204"/>Spirits into a total Deſpondency, that from that time forward, he acted as a Man irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably loſt. He took Party in the <hi>French</hi> Army, a little afore its being diſpers'd at the Paſſage of <hi>Garillan.</hi> He look'd upon that Rout, as an effect of the Diſaſters that haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him in all places, and wou'd needs there finiſh his Life. Nor was it without Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; that ſome of his Friends, faithful to the laſt, got him to go with them aboard a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, carrying Artillery, wherein he ſuffer'd Ship-wrack at the Mouth of the River, and was drown'd. His Brother the Cardinal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the news of his Death at <hi>Rome,</hi> being repair'd thither, to Congratulate the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in Bonds, upon his advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Popedom. He had met with a fainter Reception than he expected from St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſſour, after the proteſtations of Friendſhip they had mutually enterchang'd at <hi>Savona.</hi> But the impoſſibility of the good effect of any other Courſe, compell'd him to pay his Attendance, and make his Court to his Holineſs.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, ſo little affinity was there in their Humours, that the Cardinal <hi>de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici</hi> did quickly perceive, the Pope wou'd never have any Affection for his Perſon, how aſſiduous ſoever in his Devoirs, for that his Holineſs had no other Inclination, than
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:53621:205"/>for Military Virtues, and only valu'd Men according as he found them enclin'd to War. Yet the Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> had no Talents, ſave for the Court, and for Intriguing, to which the Pope did not love that any one ſhou'd be addicted.</p>
            <p>This is the Motive put the Cardinal <hi>de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici</hi> upon contriving indirect means for his Preferment. That which did his buſineſs came from the Aſſiduity he paid to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal-Nephew, call'd <hi>Galeotto,</hi> much about his Age. He had obſerv'd this young Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal to have no Paſſion, ſave for Luxury, and to be only Charm'd with what was glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering to his Eyes. He felt in his Heart a like Diſpoſition; and tho' he had not the means to indulge it in all its extent; yet, ſtrain he did, to imitate, as much as poſſible this Cardinal Nephew, and reſolv'd at the ſame time, to ſupply by Neatneſs and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs, what he wanted in abundance.</p>
            <p>He found People who lent him Moneys, to make the braveſt, gentileſt Train; and the Equipage of Hunting, which he kept, had I know not what, ſo peculiar, and gallant, that bating two or three old Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, whom it ſcandaliz'd, not a Perſon at <hi>Rome</hi> but eſteem'd him the more. No place of the Town afforded better Eating and Treating than his Houſe; for tho' he
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:53621:205"/>had not ſerv'd upon his Table, the prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous number and quantity of Diſhes, which the Princes and Cardinals lov'd to pile and faggot upon theirs, the Nice found the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goo</hi>'s to be moſt exquiſite upon <hi>Medici</hi>'s Board, ſuch a Faculty had the Patrons gay, facetious Humours, at gentilely ſupplying to Luxury. But what attracted moſt People, was his Chamberlain, <hi>Bibiana,</hi> whoſe Match had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been, for entertaining of Company. Well enough made was he of his Perſon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd nothing of the Village, his Birth-place, ſave the Name he bore.</p>
            <p>His Wit ſo pregnant in Inventions, upon whatever matters apply'd to, that thoſe who knew him intimately, averr'd him an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible Fountain of Joy. He made a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, handſome Reception to all People, had ever an hundred new Stories, for provoking Mirth and Laughter, without ever bolting ought, or Impious, or Low, or Immodeſt. Sometimes the Fancy took him in the midſt of the Repaſt, to prepare Sauces, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came into any Cooks head. He ſet about it, and ever perform'd to the guſts, and contentment of the Gueſts; or that he was Maſter of the Art of ſoothing Peoples Taſtes, or that thoſe who judg'd of his Performances, help'd to deceive their own Palates and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In a word, he ſtill furniſht, after
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:53621:206"/>the meal was done, ingenious ways for Joy and Recreation, for a whole Afternoon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>Yet, in this, <hi>Bibiana</hi>'s topping Wit did not conſiſt, nor was it the moſt material Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that he did his Maſter. He had the knack to engage Perſons to lend the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Money, without giving them Security for repayment, or furniſhing them with other Mortgage, than the Scheme he had caus'd to be erected of the Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi>'s Nativity, which promis'd this Prelate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Riches, and maintain'd he wou'd owe nothing at his Death, which prov'd true. But there was then ſo little ſhaddow of ſuch a viciſſitude, that the World cou'd not ſufficiently admire his own Boldneſs, and his Creditors Credulity.</p>
            <p>The Learned frequented the Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi>'s Palace on another Motive; for tho' the Library of his Family had been rifl'd, yet it had only loſt the Manuſcripts, which the King of <hi>England</hi> had caus'd to be bought of the <hi>French</hi> Souldiers. The reſt clutch'd by the common People, and the <hi>Suizzers,</hi> were redeem'd at a low rate, by Perſons affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, to the Houſe of <hi>Medici,</hi> and reſtor'd to the Cardinal, by <hi>Soderini</hi>'s Connivance, he being over-joy'd that he drew from <hi>Florence,</hi> all to him belonging, that he might have
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:53621:206"/>no pretence left for returning thither. The Cardinal, after having plac'd conveniently his Manuſcripts, invited Men of Learning to come ſtudy in his Palace. They were civilly receiv'd, Perſons were at hand capable of ſolving their difficulties; Conferences were weekly held, at which the Cardinal often aſſiſted, and ſpoke in his turn with a gracefulneſs, as Charm'd all his Auditors.</p>
            <p>But, as his Predominant Paſſion was Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and as he Sung, and Compos'd to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Conſorts were kept, in which the moſt Expert endeavour'd to acquire or aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their Repute. Thus his Home being become the moſt curious Retreat in <hi>Rome,</hi> the Cardinal Nephew meeting only in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici</hi>'s Palace, his Darling Diverſions, reſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thither often, and finding the Maſter's Humour conformable to his own, ſtruck up with him a ſtrict Union and Friendſhip. He told his Uncle, that the Eſteem he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd for the Cardinal <hi>de Medici,</hi> commenc'd from a Diſcourſe he had heard him make, to ſhew how a Worthy Man never wants any thing, provided he is not firſt wanting to himſelf. And the mutual tye of theſe two Cardinals became ſo ſtrong, that the Popes Nephew engag'd to promote, by all poſſible means, Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi>'s Election, when the Holy See ſhou'd fall vacant. But he
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:53621:207"/>knew not of his dying before his Uncle, and that he ſhou'd not be in a condition to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Promiſe. A burning Fever, three years after, cropt him off in the Flower of his Age. His death ſo ſenſibly afflicted Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>de Medici,</hi> that he wou'd have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate, but for an advantage he thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd, beyond his Expectation.</p>
            <p>The Pope, who had an extraordinary fondneſs for his Nephew, fell to cheriſh ſuch things as cou'd ſweeten the memory of him, and became more familiar with Cardinal <hi>de Medici.</hi> He wou'd needs have him tell him what they had perform'd together moſt gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, and ſuffer'd him inſenſibly to make ſome Digreſſions upon the Reſtauration of his Family: Nay, he one day told him, he might endeavour it without being diſown'd, provided he did not expoſe his Purple, or the Authority of the Holy See. And the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, who cou'd not then expect to obtain any thing more, form'd in <hi>Florence</hi> a new Party, by the help of his youngeſt Siſter. Her Name, <hi>Lucretia,</hi> and Nature had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd her with ſo little Beauty, as put her under the conſtraint of Wedding <hi>Giacopo Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieti,</hi> a Perſon nor the Chief, nor the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of his Family; but in recompence, ſhe abounded ſo in Wit, that ſhe inſinuated her ſelf into the good Humour of all that knew
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:53621:207"/>her. She prov'd extraordinary pregnant, and the multitude of her Children, made her afraid of one day wanting neceſſaries for their ſubſiſtence. The means to provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch a Calamity, was to contribute (as much as in her lay) to the re-eſtabliſhment of her Brothers, but ſhe met very great Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in her purſuit of this Deſign For her Husband had been one of <hi>Savanarola</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, and his mind was ſtill prejudic'd with the Maximes of that Prieſt. However, as there is hardly any thing, but what Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men obtain from thoſe who love them, when they perſevere in their colloguing Importunities, <hi>Lucretia de Medici</hi> at laſt, entic'd <hi>Salvieti</hi> to act obliquely and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his own Intereſts and Sentiments, and to ſolicite under-hand, the calling back of a Family, which he foreſaw muſt needs, one day, bereave his Country of its Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, he went ſo craftily to Work, as gave not the leaſt hold on him; for whereas thoſe who had gone before him in this Project, had declar'd it openly, he kept his Game cloſe, and only Caball'd in ſuch manner, as to diſcredit <hi>Soderini,</hi> and thwart all he aim'd at having done. He found moſt of the Nobles in the Diſpoſition he deſir'd, and in three Months ſpace, hamper'd the Dictator
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:53621:208"/>in ſuch a Perplexity, that any other than he, wou'd have deſpair'd of getting rid of. The Dictator propoſed not any Perſon to the mind of that Critical Faction. Whatever a Mans Abilities might be, he was ever put by, when propos'd by <hi>Soderini;</hi> and if any one ſuddenly allow'd of, it was ſuch an one as of whom they hop'd ſuddenly to have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to make Complaints, ſo to reject up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Government, the Faults he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The Dictators beſt actions were ill interpreted, and the leaſt aggravated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond probability. They tang'd the Good, and added to the Bad, that ſo they might have the more dangerous effects; but all this was only Froth of the Sea againſt a Rock.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soderini</hi> only confronted Patience againſt ſo many Contradictions; but this Patience being ever equal, broak and ſurmounted, at the long run, all that joſtl'd it. He uſed this addreſs, of whoſe Knowledge, it would be a Crime to rob the Reader. He had ſtill freſh Men to preſent in the room of thoſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom <hi>Salvieti</hi> and his Caball had paſt the Excluſion, and the Merit of thoſe Men ſo Conſpicuous, that the Malignity wou'd have been too palpable in rejecting them. They, as ſoon as in Employment, were moſt peculiarly ſolicitous to commit no Faults, as ſeeing themſelves too narrowly
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:53621:208"/>watcht; and when they had tript and blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er'd, they choſe rather to be their own Accuſers in Publick, than give occaſion to their Adverſaries, to heighten their Failings, by Malevolent Calumnies and Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soderini</hi> protected them, on his part, with an ingenious firmneſs; he ever gave the People pertinent Reaſons for his Conduct; he kept under-hand credible Agents enow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Populace, to inform him of News, according as they were buzz'd about; and laying down for Principle, that nothing could alter the Government of <hi>Florence,</hi> as long as the <hi>French</hi> were Potent in <hi>Italy.</hi> He maintain'd his good Underſtanding with the Majeſty of <hi>France</hi> his Miniſters, and left Vulgar Concernes to take their wonted courſe. And indeed, tho' Cardinal <hi>de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici</hi> lay ſtill at lurch, and the number of his Friends augmented daily at <hi>Florence,</hi> forrc'd was he to wait for a ſtronger Machine than his own, to ſtagger the Foundation of <hi>Soderini</hi>'s Greatneſs.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Giulio</hi> having baniſh'd from his Heart the Inclination he had fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd for <hi>France,</hi> above thirty years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, became its greateſt Enemy, and graſpt at nothing leſs, than the recovering from that Crown, all it held beyond the <hi>Alpes.</hi>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:53621:209"/>To execute ſo magnanimous a Project, not a more fitting Miniſter had he, than the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>de Medici,</hi> as being moſt concern'd in the Deſign, and the Pope fixt his Eyes on him to be its principal Inſtrument, by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him Legate of <hi>Bologna.</hi> The Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> accepted this Commiſſion, rather to evade the Duns and Importunities of his Creditors, beginning to perſecute him, than out of any proſpect he had of Succeſs. In a few days after his Arrival at <hi>Bologna,</hi> he perform'd an important piece of Service to the Eccleſiaſtical State, by diſcovering a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, framing to reſtore the <hi>Bentivogli</hi>'s to the Poſſeſſion of that agreeable City. Then he fell to obſerving <hi>Soderini,</hi> who ſeeing <hi>France</hi> embroil'd with the Church, caus'd the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> to declare in favour of the Moſt Chriſtian King, tho' he well enough foreſaw the extraordinary accumulation of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles he was going to draw upon his Back.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> not having found a Holineſs hardy enough to thwart them directly, ſince <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8th, who had been ſo unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in ſo doing, ſhew'd at firſt an irreſolution, as redoubled their enemies Courage, then perceiving their fault, fell of a ſudden into the other extremity, which conſiſted in keeping no more meaſures with the Pope. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd him of having aſcended the Throne of
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:53621:209"/>Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> by two irregular ways, thoſe of Symony and Fraud. To juſtifie the Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they inſtanc'd the Benefices and Legati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons promis'd in the Conclave, and giv'n af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Election to the Cardinals, Heads of the Faction, and ſpecify'd the ſums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which the other Cardinals had receiv'd for the price of their Suffrages.</p>
            <p>To lay open the deceipt, demonſtrated it was to the ſame Pope, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals being ingag'd by Oath, to give their Votes only for him who ſhou'd be propos'd to them by Duke <hi>Valentino;</hi> the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in Bonds, that Duke's ſworn Enemy, had him perſuaded, by ſuborned Perſons, into a Belief of his being his Father; that he had had Commerce with his Mother, at the time ſhe ſeem'd to abandon her ſelf only to Cardinal <hi>Borgia,</hi> afterwards <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the 6th, that the jealouſie this ſame <hi>Borgia</hi> had conceiv'd of him, had been the only cauſe of the Perſecution he made him ſuffer, for above ten years together; but now the thing in hand, being the Creating another Pope, if he'd favour his Promotion, he'd treat him as his Son. Duke <hi>Valentino</hi> crediting what had been told him under the Roſe, gave ſo far way, as to conſent, that the Cardinals of the Faction ſhou'd Elect St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in Bonds, who fail'd not immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:53621:210"/>to diveſt him of all <hi>Romagna</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria,</hi> inſtead of owning him for his Son.</p>
            <p>In proceſs of theſe Myſteries, which the <hi>French</hi> openly reveal'd, they form'd a Party of eight Cardinals, the moſt conſiderable of the Sacred Colledge. Dean <hi>Carvaial</hi> was one, upon a Promiſe made him, of chuſing him, after <hi>Giulio</hi> was depoſed. And <hi>San Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verino,</hi> who, having ever been a declared Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizan for <hi>France,</hi> thought it an Infamy to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon that Crown, in a Conjuncture, when the Pope was the Aggreſſor: but the moſt eſteem'd of all, was the Cardinal <hi>Soderini,</hi> Brother to the perpetual Dictator of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>

            <p>This Prelate, in the common vogue, had all the qualities requiſite to the being a Pope. Learned, Serious, Bold, and Staid in all his actions, had ever liv'd in ſuch ſort, as that he cou'd be upbraided with nothing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency, diſhonouring <hi>Giulio</hi>'s Papacy. And the ſeverity of Life he affected, gave room to hope, that, when Pope, he wou'd uſefully labour to the reformation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Not but that he had two Infirmities capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of balancing ſo many Virtues, namely, Ambition, and Avarice; but he mask'd them with ſo many Precautions, that they only ſeem'd a loftineſs of Soul, and an inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Thriftineſs, which all the <hi>Florentines</hi>

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:53621:211"/>ſhou'd act ſo dangerous and difficult a part Taken, was he, at his word, as imagining the bare Zeal he had for <hi>France,</hi> made him ſay it. Thus <hi>Giulio</hi> being departed <hi>Rome,</hi> to go to <hi>Bologna,</hi> the ſeven Cardinals left him on the Road, and gave out, that their Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to hold a Council, after the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> for the reforming in it the Church, in its Head and in its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. They wanted, for this purpoſe, a City, on the one ſide not too far remote from the Theatre of War, and on the other, ſafe from Surprize. And <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>erini</hi> was deſir'd to lend them that of <hi>Piſa.</hi> He ſufficiently foreſaw, that if he did ſo, he ſhou'd render the Pope his irreconciliable Adverſary, and give a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Pretext to other his Enemies, to decry his Adminiſtration. Nevertheleſs, he did not one moment heſitare to grant it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Demand ſeem'd to him equally juſt and neceſſary, or that he was already too far engag'd to go back.</p>
            <p>Thus the Council was conven'd at <hi>Piſa</hi> And the Pope, a Pretender to Intrepidity, dreaded it at firſt; but was re-incourag'd by <hi>Antonio de Monte,</hi> the famous Lawyer, whom he had made Cardinal at the firſt Promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               </gap> two notable Flaws were in the Convocation of the ſeven Cardinals; one, That the term
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:53621:211"/>of four Months, therein preſcrib'd to all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> to come thither, was too ſhort; and the other, the City of <hi>Piſa.</hi> Whereupon he exhorted the Pope to avail himſelf of theſe two Faults, not by ſhunning and declining a Council, which wou'd render him Criminal, in the Opinion of moſt of the Faithful; but by Convening another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, in a place he was Maſter of, and where, by conſequence, nothing cou'd be decided to his Prejudice. The Pope follow'd his Advice, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd call'd, on his ſide, a Council for the year following, 1513, at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Church of <hi>Lateran.</hi> This Action maintain'd <hi>Giulio</hi> in the Pontificate, by dividing the Believers into the uncertainty, of deferring to the one or other Council. Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He put ſo many Men in Arms that the Garriſon of <hi>Florence,</hi> which guarded the Council, was not ſufficient to Ward and Target it from inſult.</p>
            <p>The Council wrote their Diſtreſs to the Moſt Chriſtian King's Miniſters, in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> who ſent them immediately, with <hi>M. de Lautrec,</hi> four hundred Men at Arms, the briskeſt of the

               <hi>French</hi> Army. This re-inforcement gave the Houſe of <hi>Medici</hi>'s Friends the occaſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they had ſo long waited for, to Spirit from <hi>Soderini</hi>'s Party, the common People of <hi>Florence.</hi> Their Emiſſaries made their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints ring from Quarter to Quarter, how <hi>Soderini,</hi> that perpetual Dictator, who boaſted his being ſo paſſionate for the wellfare of his Country, yet made no ſcruple of delivering up to Strangers, a City, which the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> had not reduc'd, till after a War of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years.</p>
            <p>As the common People of <hi>Florence</hi> had been furiouſly Cock-a-hoop and Paſſionate, to ſee thoſe of <hi>Piſa</hi> reduced under their Laws, the bare apprehenſion of <hi>Lautrec</hi>'s ſetting them again at liberty, though falſe, cancell'd the Affection they had for <hi>Soderini<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> This change render'd the Nobility more bold, and made them write to the Friends they had in <hi>Piſa,</hi> that they ſhou'd in no wiſe brook the <hi>French</hi> to be ſtrongeſt in that place. There needed no more to foment a Sedition, from whence the Pope, and the Houſe of <hi>Medici</hi> derived great advantages.

            <p>The Cardinal <hi>da ſan Severino</hi> imagin'd, he of <hi>Medici</hi> had no other drift, than to ſend his Couſin to <hi>Rome,</hi> there to ſolicite his Ranſom, but this prov'd a miſtake: For the Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> foreſeeing the Conſternation, the loſs of the Battel wou'd occaſion in <hi>Rome,</hi> intended to re-incourage the Pope, by giving him to underſtand, by a Man of Credence, ſuch an one as the Commander, That the Concerns of the Conquerours were in a worſe Poſture, than thoſe of his Holineſs. And indeed, the Commander's Journey was the principal Remedy of the Popes Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.

                  </gap>rench</hi> to take him, and lead him by main force to the Council.</p>
            <p>The certain advices the Commander brought, of the Feebleneſs of the <hi>French,</hi> and
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:53621:214"/>the Harangue he made of it in full Conſiſtory, where the Pope wou'd have him heard, caus'd the Reſolution of ſcampering, to be chang'd into that of ſetting the Army again on foot. The Expedient broach'd by Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>de Medici,</hi> in his Letter for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the <hi>French</hi> Troops to disband, was approv'd in all points, and Merits being known.</p>
            <p>He demanded an abſolute Power to be ſent him, to abſolve the <hi>French,</hi> who had fought at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> without ſpecifying the fruit he pretended to reap thereby, and the Brief accordingly was forthwith expedited. The Commander carried it to the Cardinal <hi>de Medici,</hi> who had been Conducted to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan;</hi> and the Cardinal was induſtrious to get it rumor'd among the Souldiers. Such as had tenderneſs of Conſcience, flock'd in Crowds to receive Abſolution; and as the only Pennance impos'd on them, was not to fall any more into the ſame Fault, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies began to be very thin and clear in a few days. There happen'd another incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, little leſs to be fear'd; for thoſe who had been abſolv'd, valuing themſelves, upon deſpiſing the Council, receiv'd, with hiſſings, the Citations made to the Pope, at the Door of the great Church. From hence proceeded the Intreaties, which the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:53621:214"/>Council made to the Moſt Chriſtian King's Miniſters, to cauſe the Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> to paſs the <hi>Alpes,</hi> which they did not grant, till conſtrain'd thereto. And indeed the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of <hi>Normandy,</hi> Intendant of the <hi>French</hi> Army, having disbanded almoſt all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, out of an unſeaſonable piece of Thrift, the Forces of the League being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh'd, by a reinforcement of ſixteen thouſand <hi>Suizzers,</hi> which the Biſhop of <hi>Sion</hi> had Leavy'd upon his own Credit, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Pope, drew near the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> with ſuch Alacrity and Boldneſs, as made the Fathers of the Council judge they were not in ſafety, in the Capital City of that Dutchy. They had permiſſion giv'n them to go into <hi>France,</hi> and the ſame Troops, which ſerv'd them for Convoy, had order to Conduct thither the Cardinal <hi>de Medici.</hi> This plung'd that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late into ſo great a Melancholly, ſo much the deeper bottom'd, in that he cou'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no leſs, than to languiſh in an eternal impriſonment, if he paſs'd the <hi>Alpes:</hi> for as his Quality, and the Function he perform'd, in the moment of his taking, induc'd thoſe who had him, to ſet his Ranſome at an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Price, and, that beſides, his Houſe was ſo abſolutely Ruin'd, that it had no other recovery, ſave in his Perſon.

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:53621:215"/>not preſs'd by any Potentate to redeem him, wou'd never do it of his own accord; and the Cardinals Conſideration coming to diminiſh, a thing inevitable, according as he ſhou'd remain longer in Priſon, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time they wou'd make no more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of him, than of a Man in his Grave.</p>
            <p>This Motive determin'd him, by all the means poſſible, to ſeek the occaſion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his eſcape, afore conſtrain'd to paſs the <hi>Alpes.</hi> He conferr'd about it with the Abbot <hi>Bongalle,</hi> taken and left with him, in quality of Chamberlain, and their Reſolve was, the indeavouring to Corrupt ſome or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to attempt their reſcue. They had, for this purpoſe, the Money giv'n them, for Certificates of Abſolution, and the ſum ſufficiently conſiderable; the number of thoſe demanding thoſe Certificates, being ſo great, that the Cardinal and his Servants had been conſtrain'd to drudge at it Day and Night, during their abode at <hi>Milan.</hi> They had alſo ſome Rings, which the generous Counteſs <hi>Bianca Rangoni</hi> had accomodated them withall, in their paſſage thro' <hi>Bologna,</hi> and the Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> had, all his Life long, ſo tender an acknowledgment for this Obligation that he thought himſelf ſtill indebted to that fair Lady, after having
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:53621:215"/>made one of her Sons Cardinal, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther General of the Armies of the Church. But he met with, on the way, ſo few Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons proper for the perpetrating his Deſign, that he arriv'd on the brink of the <hi>Po,</hi> in the Territory of <hi>Florence.</hi> The Fathers of the Council ſtill trembling, were obſtinately earneſt to paſs this River that ſame Evening, ſo to put it between them, and the Popes Men, whom they fancy'd at their heels. They found Boats ready, and in they went. But the Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> dreaded paſſing it, through a contrary Sentiment; for he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw, that after his Paſſage, no more means wou'd there be for his eſcape. The anxiety he lay under, gave him the grudging of a Fever, which ſerv'd him for a pretext to ask of the Souldiers, who ſtaid about him, the permiſſion of paſſing the Night in the Village of <hi>Carro,</hi> ſtanding upon the River, on the <hi>Milan</hi> ſide.</p>
            <p>Two things made them not deny him this Requeſt; the one, that the Mareſchal <hi>de Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulee</hi> had ordered they ſhou'd uſe him with due Reſpect, and all poſſible Civility; the other, that the Vineyards of <hi>Carro</hi> being much eſteem'd, the Souldiers not attending the Fathers of the Council, did not want much entreaty to ſup there. Thus Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> was left in the Village; and the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:53621:216"/>Abbot <hi>Bongalle,</hi> after having had him put to Bed, and taken with him his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Jewels, went to find out a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his acquaintance, call'd <hi>Rinaldo Zacti,</hi> at his Caſtle not far diſtant. This <hi>Zacti</hi> was an Old Cavalier, had ſerv'd till grown hoary in his Armour, and did not retire home, till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>French,</hi> whom he hated, were become Maſters of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan;</hi> he had made ſemblance of accomodating himſelf with them, that he might enjoy in quiet, the beauteous Lands he poſſeſs'd along the <hi>Po;</hi> but, in reality, only waited for an occaſion to injure them, without ruining himſelf. He receiv'd very civilly the Abbot <hi>Bongalle,</hi> and teſtify'd much joy at the news he told him, that (according to all appearances) the <hi>French</hi> were going to be driven out of <hi>Italy. Bongalle</hi> finding him in ſo favourable a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, diſclos'd his Deſign, withall propoſing Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi>'s Reſcue, after having prov'd this Cardinal to be the Worthieſt Member of the Sacred Colledge, and ſo in reaſon to be the moſt conſider'd of thoſe, who pretended to the Papacy. Nevertheleſs, they were leading him into <hi>France,</hi> where ſure he was of ending his days in the ſame Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, wherein <hi>Lodovico Sforza</hi> died at ten years end, if not ſuddenly ſnatcht from a ſcore of Drunkards, who began to guzzle
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:53621:216"/>and drown their Senſes in the Inn of <hi>Carro.</hi> The remembrance of <hi>Lodovico Sforza,</hi> whoſe Menial Servant <hi>Zacti</hi> had been, reviv'd his averſion to <hi>France,</hi> and the eaſineſs of ſaving the Cardinal <hi>de Medici,</hi> fluſht him with the deſire.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, he did not poſitively en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and gave no other promiſe to the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot <hi>Bongalle,</hi> but of going to Communicate the buſineſs to a Gentleman, call'd <hi>Viſimbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> his Neighbour and intimate. Friend, tho' he had ſided with <hi>France.</hi> That if <hi>Viſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardi</hi> wou'd be of the Party, they two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſhou'd be ſtrong enough, with their Domeſticks, to reſcue the Cardinal <hi>de Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci,</hi> and wou'd not fail of undertaking it; but if that Gentleman refus'd him his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it was not to be hoped he wou'd hazzard alone, a Reſcue of that Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>The Abbot <hi>Bongalle</hi> was little ſatisfy'd, with ſeeing the liberty of his Patron remitted to the Caprice of a Man of a contrary Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. However comply'd, for want of a better Expedient, and only askt <hi>Zacti,</hi> by what means he might know if <hi>Viſimbardi</hi> wou'd ſecond him, or not. <hi>Zacti</hi> reply'd, that if this Gentleman did not eſpouſe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, no news were from him to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, but that if he did, he wou'd ſend him
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:53621:217"/>word, for a token, by a young Boy, that <hi>all was ready. Bongalle</hi> return'd to Cardinal <hi>de Medici,</hi> to render him an account of what he had done, and gave him not ſo much Hope as Fear. <hi>Zacti,</hi> on his ſide, found <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimbardi</hi> far from the deſign, he meant to inſpire into him. Nevertheleſs, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to him with ſo much efficacy, that affairs were ruin'd, that no meaſures were to be kept with People flying and ſcampering, and that Wiſdom requir'd the reconciling ones ſelf with the Conquerours, by rendring them an eminent piece of Service, that <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimbardi</hi> gave way, and promis'd <hi>Zacti</hi> to meet him about one a Clock at Night, with all the Friends and Domeſticks he could get together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zacti</hi> return'd home to make ready, and commanded a young Boy to go to the Inn of <hi>Carro,</hi> ask for the Abbot <hi>Bongalle,</hi> and tell him, <hi>all was ready.</hi> The Lad, on the way, forgot half of his Commiſſion, and remembred nothing more, when come to the Inn, ſave asking to ſpeak with the Abbot, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any proper name: The Perſon the Child ſpoke to, was a <hi>French Pedee,</hi> who hearing him mention an Abbot, imagin'd him to be the ſame, to whoſe care the Fathers of the Council, upon their paſſing the <hi>Po,</hi> had recommended the Cardinal <hi>de
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:53621:217"/>Medici.</hi> They had conjur'd him not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him out of ſight, and to make him paſs the River very early; for that intent the Souldiers of the Guard had a moſt peculiar Order to obey him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Boy calls this Abbot; and the Child, not knowing <hi>Bongalle,</hi> believ'd it to be the ſame then preſent, thought he was to do his Meſſage, and tell him, <hi>All was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> Then wou'd the Lad have gone his ways, but the Abbot he had ſpoken to, not knowing what he meant, ſtaid him, and askt him ſeveral queſtions, which he did not ſo handſomly clear, tho' he pretended to come from a poor Peaſant, whom he call'd his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that the <hi>French</hi> Abbot ſuſpected ſome Myſtery.</p>
            <p>He commanded the Souldiers to redouble their Vigilance, for the guard of their Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and went himſelf to find out the Ferry. Men that they might make ready to carry over the Cardinal at break of Day, while the Cardinal and his Chamberlain were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtrange diſquiets. As they had had no inkling of the little Boys adventure, they conceiv'd <hi>Zacti</hi> to have fail'd in his word to them, or that <hi>Viſimbardi</hi> refus'd to ſecond him. They deſpair'd of their delivery, after having ſpent the Night without hearing any Noiſe, or receiving any Notice. And it was
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:53621:218"/>not ſo much with a ſet deſign, as through a kind of retchleſneſs, which Perſons fall in when deſtitute of all hopes, that the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>de Medici</hi> was ſtill muſing in his Bed, when ſummon'd to make ready to paſs the River. Up got he, mounted his Mule, gave his Benediction to the Paſſengers, thronging to receive it at the Inn door, and ſo ſuffer'd them to lead him where they liſted.</p>
            <p>The two fore Feet of his Mule were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the Boat, when he heard a noiſe behind him, which made him turn his head. 'Twas <hi>Zacti</hi> with <hi>Viſimbardi,</hi> who came full Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, crying. <hi>Liberty.</hi> They ſurrounded the Cardinal to preſerve him from danger, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Conflict, which they expected to be ſharp; but the <hi>French</hi> ſeeing the March une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, choſe rather to abandon a Priſoner, whom it was no longer poſſible for them to keep, and throw themſelves into the Boat, juſt at hand, than to engage in a Combat, to them unprofitable, even tho' attended with Succeſs.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Zacti</hi> and his Companion remain'd Maſters of the Cardinal's Perſon, and not daring to take him home to their own Houſes where they expected ſearch to be made; <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimbardi</hi> urg'd the Conducting him to <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo Malaſpino</hi>'s Caſtle, as being a place near e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough the State of <hi>Genoua,</hi> for them there
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:53621:218"/>to take Refuge, in caſe of purſuit. <hi>Maleſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> being their Friend, at firſt made them a kind Reception; but after they had told him their buſineſs, and ſhew'd him the Cardinal <hi>de Medici,</hi> then in diſguiſe, and paſſing only for a Cavalier of their Train; then <hi>Maleſpina</hi> put on a more ſerious look, remonſtrated to them their Imprudence, in having ventur'd their Lives and Fortunes, to ſave a Perſon, to them indifferent; accus'd them of coming only to his Houſe, to render him the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice of their Crime, and uſing them as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, ſent them ſurlily away, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken from them the Cardinal <hi>de Medici,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſhut up the Cardinal in a Tennis-Court, till ſuch time as he had receiv'd directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the Mareſchal <hi>Trimulee,</hi> Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> for <hi>France,</hi> what courſe to take with the Priſoner Fortune had put into his Hands. <hi>Trimulee</hi> receiv'd <hi>Maleſpina</hi>'s Courier in the very time, that two <hi>French</hi> Souldiers, of the number of thoſe who had been puſh'd by the Confederate Army at the Paſs of <hi>Mincio,</hi> had put <hi>Milan</hi> into a Conſternation, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulging, that the Enemy wou'd be ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the Gates. The miſchief prov'd much greater than reported, for that the <hi>French</hi> Army, after this defeat, deſpairing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <hi>Milan,</hi> march'd away towards the <hi>Alpes:</hi> So as <hi>Trimulee</hi> had no more mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:53621:219"/>to keep with People that abandon'd him, notwithſtanding he had ſacrific'd all for them. He wrote a Letter to <hi>Maleſpina,</hi> to adviſe him to make a Friend of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>de Medici,</hi> by letting him go, provided he did it with ſuch Cautions, as not to ſeem the having contributed to his Eſcape.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maleſpina</hi> follow'd this Council, and went by night to the Cardinal <hi>de Medici,</hi> in the Tennis-Court, let him know the importance of the Service he meant to do him, and agreed with him that one of his Servants ſhould open the door, and keep him Company, that <hi>Maleſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> might rumour it abroad, the Cardinal had Corrupted him. The thing paſs'd as projected; but the Cardinal went not far without falling into the <hi>Banditti</hi>'s hands, who diſmounted him, took what Money he had, and kill'd <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſpina</hi>'s Servant for ſtanding on his defence Then the Cardinal wander'd alone up and down the Fields, without wiſting where he was, till he met a Curate, who knowing him led him into his Presbytery, made him the beſt Cheer he cou'd, and lent him his Mare to carry him as far as <hi>Plaiſanza.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He arriv'd at that City a moment after it had put it ſelf, of its own proper motion, under the Popes Obedience; inſomuch that the Cardinal <hi>de Medici,</hi> who entred in diſguiſed laid hold of the Conjuncture to make him
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:53621:219"/>ſelf known, and took upon him again the Badges of his Legation. He diſpatcht the moſt urgent affairs, and departed immediately after for <hi>Bologna,</hi> with a ſufficient Convoy. There he found the Inhabitants buſy'd with dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out the <hi>Bentivoglii</hi>'s, and in ſetting up the Arms of the Church. They accepted him for their Governour, till the Pope ſhou'd otherwiſe Decree. He receiv'd the Bull of it with ſo much the more joy, as that Fortune cou'd not ſend him an Employ more commodious, to lye at catch for his Families re-eſtabliſhment in <hi>Florence.</hi> And indeed the Deputies of the Pope, of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and of <hi>Italy,</hi> being aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at <hi>Mantoua,</hi> to regulate the Revenge to be inflicted on thoſe who had aſſiſted the <hi>French; Giuliano de Medici</hi> being ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Cardinal his Brother, demanded permiſſion to return into his Country. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derini</hi> had foreſeen this Requeſt, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht his Brother to <hi>Mantoua,</hi> to diſappoint it. Thus the affair being of Conſequence, and the Parties preſent, they were allow'd to debate their Pretenſions in Publick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Deputies of the League.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Giuliano de Medici</hi> maintain'd, that the <hi>Florentines</hi> ought to be treated as Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Peace of <hi>Italy;</hi> and undergo the Penalties ordain'd by the <hi>Roman</hi> Law,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:53621:220"/>againſt the Diſſerters of the common Cauſe, ſeeing they had ſent Succours to the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>French,</hi> in the Land of <hi>Milan. Soderini</hi>'s Brother, being a great Lawyer anſwer'd pertinently to the Accuſation, and render'd it ridiculous. He own'd the point in iſſue, but ſhow'd a Treaty the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> had concluded, long afore, with the <hi>French,</hi> for the giving one another mutually a limitted Succours, if needed by <hi>Tuſcany</hi> on one ſide, and the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> on the other.</p>
            <p>He added, that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> holding the firſt Rank in <hi>Italy,</hi> after the Pope, had ſo little thought this Treaty prejudicial to them, in what related to the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> that the Republick of <hi>Florence</hi> had thereunto conſented. And how it was, by virtue of this Treaty, that the Great Captain had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Cavalry from <hi>Florence,</hi> when he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the Paſs at <hi>Garillan;</hi> that with excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Articles ſtipulated in thoſe two Treaties, the <hi>Florentines</hi> had inviolably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the Neutrality, that their Colours had neither been unfolded in the Army of <hi>Gaſton de Foix,</hi> nor in that of Marſhal <hi>de la Palice,</hi> and that the two Parties had been equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and furniſh'd with Proviſions, in their paſſage through <hi>Tuſcany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Reaſons were concluding, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in regard of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:53621:220"/>Judges in the Caſe. And 'tis not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but that <hi>Soderini</hi>'s Brother haid gain'd his Cauſe, if he had ſpoke before Judges as diſ-intereſſed, as they were Intelligent. But as they had to do with Souldiers, who knew not how to do Juſtice, without thereby rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Profit, one of his Friends, advis'd him under-hand, not to truſt ſo abſolutely in the merits of his Cauſe, that this ſhou'd hinder him from diſtributing, in the Aſſembly, the Gold and Silver he had brought along from <hi>Florence.</hi> He ſlighted the Advice, and repartee'd, that if he did it, his Brother wou'd have reaſon to tax him with Prodigality, and upbraid him, that he had had a very ill Opinion of his Cauſe, ſince he had offer'd to Corrupt his Judges.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Giuliano de Medici</hi> did not follow the ſame Courſe, and pour'd out whole handfuls of Gold, which the Cardinal his Brother had borrow'd from the principal Citizens of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna.</hi> The Aſſembly was almoſt wholly compos'd of Deputies of the States of <hi>Italy,</hi> and of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Colonels, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt their Equipages, at the Battel of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna,</hi> were contriving to ſet themſelves up again, and were not affected with the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Sentiments, that wou'd have made Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon the Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> who had ſent them.
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:53621:221"/>Inſomuch that <hi>Giuliano de Medici</hi> taking them by their weak ſide, perſuaded them, that the affair in agitation, was a thing of Grace, and not of Juſtice, and got from them a Sentence, in form of Proſcription, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Republick of <hi>Florence,</hi> tho' they had declar'd, two hours afore, to <hi>Soderini</hi>'s Brother, that nothing cou'd be more unjuſt, than the Pretentions of the <hi>Medici.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soderini</hi> having receiv'd the News of it, did not loſe time, in declaming againſt his Brother's Imprudence and Parcimony. He took out what was moſt precious in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Treaſury, and putting it into the Hands of his principal Confident, call'd <hi>Giovanni Gia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copo Albizzi,</hi> ſent him to <hi>Raymond</hi> of <hi>Cardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> to indeavour, by all means, the obſtructing the Execution of the Sentence. <hi>Cardonna</hi> was a Man not of a humour to violate Equity, when the Orders of the Catholick King, his Maſter, did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force him to it. He had diſapprov'd the Reſult of the Aſſembly of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> and made ſo kind a Reception to <hi>Soderini</hi>'s Envoy, as conceiv'd a jealouſie in the Cardinal <hi>de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici,</hi> who had ſpyes about that Vice-King, and made him not doubt, but that he wou'd thwart them, if the affair depended on him. And nevertheleſs, eaſie was it to ſee that he wou'd be Maſter of the buſineſs, in caſe the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:53621:221"/>leaſt protracted. Wherefore neceſſary was it to induce thoſe who had newly proſcrib'd the <hi>Florentines</hi> to depart immediately, to go themſelves execute the Proſcription, and <hi>Giu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liano de Medici</hi> diſpos'd them to it, by new Preſents. The Duke of <hi>Attio</hi> and <hi>Petro de Padillo,</hi> who had been Corrupted, march'd thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Infantry, and the Pope's Troops had orders to follow them.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> the Pope's Nephew, Commanding theſe Forces, had more Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to buoy up <hi>Soderini,</hi> who cou'd not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure him, than re-eſtabliſh thoſe who did not love him. He practis'd all imaginable ſhifts, to diſpenſe his obeying the Pope, his Uncle, he caus'd the Artillery to be nail'd, and wou'd needs imploy his Souldiers in ſome other expedition. But the <hi>Orſini</hi>'s led him thither againſt his will, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being engag'd in the Siege of <hi>Prato,</hi> where they met with a vigorous Defence; two Foot Souldiers obſerv'd a Defect in the Wall, and ſhew'd it to their Companions, who there forc'd the Place. All in it underwent Fire and Sword; and the news being carry'd to <hi>Florence,</hi> occaſion'd there a pannick Terror. To remedy which, <hi>Soderini</hi> went himſelf to the Houſes, and had thoſe ſeiz'd whom he ſuſpected of Correſpondence with the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci.</hi> The Tumult increaſing, compell'd him to retire from the Guild-Hall to his own
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:53621:222"/>Houſe, where, putting on a diſguiſe, he fled into <hi>Dalmatia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Medici</hi>'s made their entrance into <hi>Florence,</hi> as in Triumph, and ſeizing on the Publick Treaſure, diſtributed the better part of it to the Troops that follow'd them, and paid their Debts with the reſt. They diſpos'd of the Government, according to their Fancy, and convening the People, oblig'd them to aboliſh all that had been done, during the eighteen years their Exile had laſted. Then they preſented to them ſev'nty Perſons, ſuch as were at their Devotion, to ſupply the Magiſtracy; and out of this number was it, that the two Supream Councils were choſen, the one of eight Senators, who ſhou'd Judge thenceforward, and without farther Appeal of Properties and of Life; and the other Ten, who ſhou'd reſolve the Affairs of Peace and War. They re-eſtabliſh'd the Charge of <hi>Gonfalioniere</hi> to be officiated, during two Months only, and the firſt they conferr'd it on, was their Brother in Law <hi>Ridolfi,</hi> who not daring to act overtly againſt <hi>Soderini</hi>'s Friends, remaining in the City, devis'd retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting their paſt Conduct, ſo to fright them, and incline them to ſeek, of their own Election, another abode. The moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable of thoſe he perſecuted, was the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated <hi>Nicolo Machiavelli.</hi> This wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:53621:222"/>Genius was not of mean Birth, but had wanted Education. He knew ſo little <hi>Latin,</hi> that in writing upon <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he did not well underſtand the Text he alledges, nay, and ſometimes takes it in a wrong ſenſe. As to the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, he knew not ſo much as how to read it; but he had the happineſs to ſerve for an <hi>Amanuenſis</hi> to the Learned <hi>Marcelio Virgile,</hi> who made him extract what was moſt Quaint in good Authors, and gave him ſince occaſion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe in his own Works, the fineſt ſtroaks of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> of <hi>Lucian,</hi> and other the Maſter-pieces of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, which are found therein, ſo delicately Tranſlated. Yet was he not wanting to give an Idea, after his Mode, of a Prince, of a Senator, and a Souldier. As he had a Libertine Wit, and that his Manners were diſſolute, he ever lov'd the Anarchical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and favour'd only that of Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, as coming nearer Anarchy than the reſt. He was of all the Factions that were hatcht in his time, againſt the <hi>Medici,</hi> and <hi>Ridolfi</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Convicted him of having been concern'd in that of their Exile, caus'd him to be taken, and put to the Rack, to make him reveal his Accomplices. He indur'd it with an obſtinate ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> not having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, without regret, to his being tortur'd, caus'd him to be inlarg'd, and for a reparation,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:53621:223"/>order'd him to have a great Penſion from the Publick, in quality of Hiſtoriographer.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Machiavell</hi> wrote the eight Books we have of the Hiſtory of his Country, whoſe ſtile is ſo blooming and Correct, that it's tax'd with being too Finical and Tawdry. And principally in this, <hi>Boccacio's</hi> eaſineſs and ſoft Liberty, has got of him the Preference. His Narration is ſometimes Malign and Satyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; and <hi>Marc-Muſurus</hi> convinc'd him of it ſo clearly, that he durſt not anſwer him. They will needs have too, that he has flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd his Country-men, and exaggerated their Noble Actions; but I do not perceive that they have plainly ſhewn wherein and how.</p>
            <p>His greateſt misfortune lay, in his not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to rid himſelf of the Inclination he had for Liberty, and of having ill practis'd the precepts of diſſimulation he gave to others. He bolted now and then, even in his Hiſtory, Teſtimonies of Admiration for <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> a thing odd and unſeaſonable, in a Man deſignedly ſet to write, in order to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate into Peoples minds, the Dominion of the <hi>Medici.</hi> Nevertheleſs, his allowance was continued to him, having found the Secret of pleaſing the Cardinal <hi>de Medici,</hi> in diverting him with admirable ſtrokes and ſallies of the fineſt Raillery, which he invented to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, upon all ſorts of Subjects.</p>
            <pb n="361" facs="tcp:53621:223"/>
            <p>One day that he counterfeited the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures and irregular Deportments, of ſome of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> the Cardinal told him they wou'd appear very ridiculous upon the Stage, in a Comedy made in imitation of that of <hi>Ariſtophanes.</hi> There needed no more to ſet <hi>Machiavell</hi> to work upon <hi>Clitia,</hi> wherein the Parties he meant to ridicule, are drawn ſo to the Life, that they durſt not be angry, tho' they aſſiſted at the firſt repreſentation of the Piece, for fear of augmenting the publick laughter, by betraying themſelves. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>de Medici</hi> was ſo Charm'd with it, that being afterwards Pope, he caus'd the Decora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Threatre, the Habits, and the very Actors themſelves, to be removed to <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſo he might afford his Court the Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Play.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Machiavell</hi> found this turn to account, and receiv'd extraordinary Gratifications from Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> till that the Conſpiracy of <hi>Ajaceti</hi> and of <hi>Almanni,</hi> to aſſaſſinate all the <hi>Medici</hi>'s being diſcover'd, they had violent tokens, of its not being contriv'd without <hi>Machiavelli</hi>'s Participation; but he had gone ſo ſlily to work, that nothing cou'd be prov'd upon him. They durſt not ſo much as apply him to the Torture, well knowing he wou'd endure it, without making any Diſcovery. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themſelves with diſcrediting him, and
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:53621:224"/>abandoning him to the miſery a man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, having ſpent all. He lay under the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a Profligate Wretch, and an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt. And the little care he took to purge himſelf, made what was ſaid of him, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally believed to be but too true. He unwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly occaſion'd his own Death, by taking out of Prevention a Medicine, which ſtifl'd him, but I have not found that he wou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacraments, till after being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained ſo to do by the Magiſtrates.</p>

            <head>THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE HOUSE OF MEDICIS. The Sixth Book.</head>
            <p>CArdinal <hi>de Medici</hi> had not yet been three Months return'd to <hi>Florence,</hi> when the Death of Pope <hi>Giulio</hi> the Second oblig'd him to leave that place, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for his repairing to <hi>Rome.</hi> He made his journey in a Litter, by reaſon of an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thume he had in thoſe parts, which Modeſty
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:53621:225"/>forbids mentioning, and travell'd ſo ſlowly, that the Pope's Obſequies were already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, and the Conclave begun, before his Arrival. He remembred <hi>Marcileo Ficino,</hi> his Father's intimate Friend, who had Erected his Scheme, at the moment of his Birth, and had ſeveral times affirmed him to be born under a Conſtellation, promiſing him the Papacy. But this Prediction had not ſo ſtrongly affected him, as that of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> the famous <hi>German</hi> Aſtrologer, who an hour before the Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> entred the Conclave, ſignify'd to all the Cardinals there, that to no purpoſe was it for them to renew their Intrigues, and that infallibly not a Man of them ſhou'd be Pope. The Faithful <hi>Bibiana</hi> wou'd needs be the Cardinal <hi>de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici</hi>'s Conclaviſt, and ſerv'd him with ſo much the more application, that his principa Talent lay for the Negotiation in hand, and indeed no hard matter was it for him, to gain for his Maſter the Suffrages of two ſorts of Cardinals, who durſt not hope to be choſen; one ſort, becauſe they were ſuſpected to the Sacred Colledge, as being iſſu'd from Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Houſes; and the other, by reaſon of their two green Youth, and the little Account they were in, as to what concern'd the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. As the Cardinals of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Gonzaga, Sion, Corneli, Sauli,</hi> and <hi>Petrucci</hi>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:53621:225"/>Some alſo of the Pretenders were there, who promis'd him their Votes, on condition that <hi>Medici</hi> wou'd give them his, in caſe they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wanted it to have the number ſufficient. The firſt put to the Vote, was Cardinal <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ario,</hi> and his Cabal was ſo much the more powerful, in that almoſt all thoſe, who ow'd their Promotion to <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 4th, declar'd in favour of his Nephew, either that they hop'd to ſhare among them ſo many rich Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices falling vacant, by <hi>Riario</hi>'s Exaltation, or that they meant thereby to teſtifie their Gratitude to the memory of their Benefactor. But two invincible Obſtacles quickly chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated <hi>Riario</hi>'s Fortune; one, that the young Cardinals were afraid this old <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> making Profeſſion of living auſterely, wou'd oblige them to reform the Luxury, wherein the two fore-going Popes had ſuffer'd them to bask; the other, that not one of the Old aſpiring Cardinals, cou'd be prevail'd with, to favour him with his Suffrage, ſo fully were they perſuaded, that he needed but one or two Voices to make up the two thirds. The ſteddineſs they ſhew'd, in not conſenting to the Exaltation of any of the Young, made the Young knit, in their turn, a more ſtrict Combination among themſelves, not to give their Votes to the Ancients, and becauſe they muſt agree among themſelves,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:53621:226"/>to avert the Publick Odium, they reſign'd their Pretenſions to Cardinal <hi>de Medici.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſuffer'd their Faction to make a noiſe, as ſoon as formed, and an hour after, known was it throughout all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave, that there wou'd be a young Pope, or none at all. Endeavours were uſed to diſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite them, and he who ſet moſt Wheels a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to bring this about, was Cardinal <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derini,</hi> who had ſuch juſt Cauſes to obviate his moſt formidable Adverſaries becoming his Maſter. But finding among them a too good underſtanding, and knowing beſides the weakneſs of the Ancients, he did not doubt, but what he moſt dreaded wou'd come to paſs.</p>
            <p>I have already noted Cardinal <hi>Soderini</hi> to have been both the moſt Crafty and Self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed of all the Sacred Colledge; and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biana</hi> knowing this defect, attack'd him there. He lur'd him with hopes of an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment for his Brother, as advantageous as that of <hi>Florence,</hi> and propos'd the Ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Houſe of <hi>Medici</hi> with that of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derini,</hi> by the Marriage of <hi>Soderini</hi>'s Niece, with the Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi>'s Nephew. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derini</hi> found this offer to his advantage; and the Sureties having been giv'n on both ſides, he fortify'd the young Cardinals Party, by joining it with thoſe of his own Faction.</p>
            <pb n="367" facs="tcp:53621:226"/>
            <p>Thus ſtood the Affair, when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave was fill'd with Terror, by ſlipping in a Note to it, written from good Hands, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, that the Cardinals, who had conven'd, and held the Council of <hi>Piſa,</hi> from whence they were forced to ſhift into <hi>France,</hi> had took Shipping at <hi>Thoulon,</hi> and were coming full ſail to enter the Conclave, before the Election was over. Certain it was, that their arrival wou'd create great Troubles, and break all the meaſures taken by <hi>Bibiana,</hi> for the Promotion of Cardinal <hi>de Medici,</hi> becauſe that, on the one ſide, the Cardinals coming from <hi>France,</hi> had been Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and Degraded by the late Pope, who had declar'd his Reſolution, to have them burn'd before the Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> if they fell into his hands; on the other ſide, as they were Old Cardinals, they fore-ſaw that their Co-Brothers, to fortifie their Faction, and render it, by a new Addition, ſuperiour to that of the Young, wou'd by all means let them into the Conclave. And in order to the taking off the Cenſures, and reſtoring them, wou'd uſe the abſolute Power, which the Conclave pretends to have, during the Vacancy of the Holy See, which wou'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly cauſe a Schiſm. It muſt needs be own'd that never was Conclave ſo much at a plunge, as this wou'd have been, had the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:53621:227"/>Cardinals, they expected, come. But Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that deſtin'd the Papacy to Cardinal <hi>de Medici,</hi> eluded their Purpoſes by a furious ſtorm, which ſeiz'd them at their very put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the Port of <hi>Thoulon,</hi> and ſuffer'd them not to go on ſhoar, in any of the places they deſir'd to touch at, and left them not, till after having ſplit their Ships, and thrown their Perſons upon the Coaſt of <hi>Piſa,</hi> where the Magiſtrates were devoted to the Cardinal <hi>de Medici.</hi> Theſe Magiſtrates knew that their Patron wou'd not be choſen, if the Old Cardinals got this new re-inforcement, and for the preventing it, they ſeiz'd their Gueſts, under the Shams of conſulting their Preſervation, and the Security of the Town.</p>
            <p>They gave them to underſtand, that their Heads had been ſet at a Price; and that as <hi>Tuſcany</hi> was very much infeſted by the <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti</hi>'s, there wou'd be People greedy enough of the two thouſand Crowns, that had been promis'd to whoever ſhou'd bring their Heads to <hi>Rome,</hi> as to way-lay them with a deſign to kill them, if they undertook their Journey before the new Pope, upon the point of being Elected, had moderated his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors Sentence againſt them. Little did it avail the ſev'n Cardinals to declare, that they wou'd run the riſque of that, and then
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:53621:227"/>proteſt againſt the Violence done them, and of the Right of Nations violated in their Perſons; they were penn'd up in a Houſe, ſurrounded with ſtrong Guards.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all this, the Conclave had not ended yet a while, 'cauſe the young and old Cardinals perſiſted in an equal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, without an odd Adventure, which made them jump in an Accord. Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> being extraordinarily agitated with the number of Viſits he made each Night, to all the Cardinals of his Faction, his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt hume open'd, and the purulent matter iſſuing thence, exhall'd ſuch a ſtink, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted all the Cells, ſeparated only by light Boards. The old Cardinals, whoſe Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament being leſs capable of reſiſting the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign impreſſions of ſo Corrupted an Air, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted the Phyſicians of the Conclave, about the Courſe they were to take; and the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians ſeeing the Cardinal <hi>de Medici,</hi> and judging of his Conſtitution, rather by the euil Humours that iſſu'd from his Body, than of the vigour of Nature in ſending them forth, anſwer'd, after they had been bribed by <hi>Bibiana</hi>'s Promiſes, that the Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> had not a Month longer to live. This Doom made him Pope, in that the Old-Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, thinking themſelves much Cunnin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, than the Young, were willing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:53621:228"/>them a ſatifaction, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd wou'd not be of long continuance. They went and told them, that they yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at length to their Obſtinacy, on condition the like Compliance ſhou'd be return'd them ſome other time. Thus the Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> was choſen Pope, upon a falſe inſinuation, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not yet compleated his thirty ſixth year; and as Joy is the moſt Soveraign of Remedies, he quickly after recover'd ſo perfect a Health, that the Old Cardinals had occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent for having been too Credulous. The new Pope took care to ſend a Courier to <hi>Piſa,</hi> with Orders for the ſeven Cardinals Releaſe, being there, under a Complimental Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but without reſtoring their Money, or Equipage. Inſomuch that thoſe Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies being inform'd of the upſhot of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave, and having not wherewith to return into <hi>France,</hi> were too happy in quitting their Purple, trudging to <hi>Rome</hi> in quality of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicants, and laying themſelves at the Popes Feet, who abſolv'd them, and re-inſtated them in the Sacred Colledge.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, this was not it that caus'd him to aſſume the Name of <hi>Leo;</hi> and Hiſtorian do not gueſs better, when they make him chuſe this Title, our of Emulation to his two Predeceſſors, the one of whom was call'd <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the other <hi>Julius.</hi> The truth
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:53621:228"/>is, that the Cardinal <hi>de Medici,</hi> who gave a little too much way to Predictions, then remembred a Dream his Mother had, while of him with Child: She imagin'd her ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd upon the great Altar of the Church <hi>de la Reparata,</hi> of a Lyon, beyond Compariſon, bigger and finer than thoſe the Suldan of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> had ſent to her Husband, but ſo gentle, that he did not roar, and ſo tame, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd himſelf to be Careſs'd like any little Dog.</p>

               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:53621:229"/>had been fought, and that day ſeems to have been choſen, for the better noting the inconſtancy of Humane things. The Pope was mounted upon the ſame Horſe he had had on the day of Battel; and the Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> had taken care to redeem him from a Cavalier, that rid in his own Troop, to whom he fell for his Lot of the Plunder; he was never ſince made uſe of, and was carefully fed and lookt to. The main of the Ceremony conſiſted in the three different Perſonages, which <hi>Giulio de Medici</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented that day. For in the beginning of this Solemnity, he was ſeen as a Knight of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> carrying the Great <hi>Guidon</hi> of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Then the Pope put upon his Head the Cardinals Cap, fall'n vacant by the Exaltation of his Holineſs, and purg'd his Birth of all the Defects where with it was upbraided, by ſo Authentick an Act, that it was no longer poſſible to make him paſs for a Baſtard, without calling in queſtion the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of him who declar'd him Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.

            </p>
            <p>The late Pope had order'd, at his Deat that, in the firſt place, the City of <hi>Mode</hi>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:53621:229"/>ſhou'd be purchas'd of the Emperour <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian;</hi> and his Succeſſor had a colour to ſhew, he had not needleſsly drained the Churches Coffer. It was no hard matter to conclude the Bargain for an hundred: thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Duckets, becauſe that <hi>Maximilian</hi> was of the temper of other Prodigals, who take up at all Hands, and uſe no more Precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ſelling, than in giving: But when Colonel <hi>Viefruſt</hi> was requir'd to reſign the Place, he Commanding in it a <hi>German</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, he demanded Indempnifyings, which mounted much higher than the Place had coſt. The Pope endeavour'd, at firſt, to bring him to Compliance, by the way of Negotiation; but ſeeing the Colonel abated nothing of his Fierceneſs, he mated him with a Martial Man, a Perſon as brave as himſelf, and incomparably more Cunning. This was Count <hi>Guido de Rangoni,</hi> who took his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures with the Pope, and had occaſion giv'n him of. Offence, that he might pretend Cauſe to be Malecontent. Then he went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to <hi>Modena,</hi> where <hi>Viefruſt,</hi> his Friend, received him, and afforded him the means of defecting his Garriſon, and ſhouldering him out of the Town.</p>
            <p>The Recovery of <hi>Modena</hi> brought the Pope into Repute, and gave him occaſion to think of the ſettlement of his Brother <hi>Giuliano.
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:53621:230"/>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had a Siſter to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for, who began to grow weary of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Life. She was already above thirty years old, but none had yet Courted her in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; for her Brother was too ill a Husband to give her a Portion ſuitable to her High Birth. Under theſe Circumſtances the Pope had her ſifted, whether ſhe wou'd be his Siſter in-Law, and ſent her ſuch rich Preſents, that they exceeded what ſhe was able to bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Houſe of <hi>Medici.</hi> He offer'd the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> at the ſame time, to take her without Portion, and promis'd that Duke to render him ſo powerful in <hi>Italy,</hi> that the Duke, deſiring nothing better, than to be rid of his Siſter, without her putting him to Charge, gave his Conſent. The Nuptials were extream magnificent, and the Pope ſent as far as <hi>Nice,</hi> to receive his Siſter-in-Law, and kept her the Train of a Queen. A Promotion was there of Cardinals, to honour her entry into <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Pope, that he might diſpoſe the People to receive her the more chearfully, diminiſh'd the Impoſt upon Salt.</p>
            <p>The Applauſes his Liberality produc'd excited him to Found a Colledge for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Youth, which he meant, at firſt, to render the famouſeſt in the Univerſe: For with great Charges, he prevail'd with
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:53621:230"/>
               <hi>Niphus</hi> to come thither to teach Philoſophy, <hi>Chriſtoforo d' Arezzo</hi> for Phyſick, <hi>Butigella</hi> for Law, <hi>Partaſius</hi> for Eloquence, and <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condilas</hi> for the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue. His Holineſs was ſo afraid of having Criticks find barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Expreſſions in his Briefs, which thoſe of ſome of his Predeceſſors were full of, that he choſe for his two principal Secretaries, the two Men in the World who wrote beſt, namely, <hi>Bembe,</hi> and <hi>Sadolet.</hi> He augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Library of the Vatican, whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection he committed to <hi>Beroalde</hi> the younger, who underſtood Books admirably well. He cauſed the <hi>Penulus</hi> of <hi>Plautus</hi> to be repreſented in two days, the Expence of which was exceſſive, and the Actors Poſtures too free, yet gave no Scandal. The Pope had ſo well divined this to be the way to catch the <hi>Romans,</hi> and hinder them from inveighing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Abuſes, that they erected him Statues for the very things, which had ſet them a writing Satyrs againſt the other Popes.</p>
            <p>But the Deſign <hi>Giulio</hi> had bequeathed to his Succeſſors, was too Noble to remain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. The <hi>French</hi> had been no ſooner driven out of the Land of <hi>Milan,</hi> than that they made preparations to viſit it again. They laid Siege to <hi>Novarra,</hi> and that place was then of ſuch Conſequence, that by taking it, in it wou'd they have found the Keys of
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:53621:231"/>all the other Cities of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan Maſſimilian Sforza</hi> had raiſed eight thouſand <hi>Suizzars</hi> to relieve it; but as he wanted Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, his Souldiers threatned to abandon him, afore he had led them into the preſence of the Enemies. The Pope, to remedy this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, ſent him five and twenty thouſand Crowns, which enabled him to win the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of <hi>Novarra,</hi> and preſerv'd him his Dutchy. Then the Pope chang'd his Method, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the <hi>French;</hi> for as his Deſign was only to hinder them from ſetling in <hi>Italy,</hi> he cou'd not endure that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings</hi> ſhou'd puſh them too much on the ſide of <hi>Picardy,</hi> though it was he himſelf that had invited them to the Undertaking. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenc'd them to an Accommodation, by ſuch cogent Offices, that the Peace was Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded between <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12th, on the one ſide, and the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the Arch-Duke, on the other. But his Holineſs had ſince oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to repent of his Mediation, for that the <hi>French,</hi> who cou'd not live at reſt, had no ſooner ſecured their Frontiers of <hi>Picardy,</hi> than that they bent their thoughts to the recovery of <hi>Milan.</hi> They went too about it with more warineſs than they were wont; and either that their Miniſters were become more refined, or that they had improv'd by their Loſſes; they apprehended, that their
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:53621:231"/>Deſign wou'd ne're ſucceed, unleſs they act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Concert with the <hi>Genoueſes. Octavian Fregoſſa</hi> had an Authority among thoſe free People, little inferiour to the Supream. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> the firſt, who began to Reign in <hi>France,</hi> got his Pulſe felt by ſuch skillful Emiſſaries, that he divorc'd himſelf from the Union of the other Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> tho' he had paſt his Word to the Pope, not to enter upon any Treaty without his Participation. The Pope believing him ſincere, had bottom'd upon his Faith the moſt important of his Intrigues, which Merits being known. Several marks of Folly had 'ſcap'd from <hi>Maſſimilian Sforza,</hi> as gave occaſion to believe, that he might be ſtript of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> without ſcruple, ſeeing he was no longer in a Condition to defend it againſt the <hi>French,</hi> nor ſo much as to Converſe among Men. The Pope then contriving his Brother <hi>Giuliano</hi>'s Fortune, judg'd there cou'd never be a more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Opportunity offer'd for his aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſement. He open'd his mind to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> whoſe unquiet humour diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd of nothing that departed from Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This Duke fully confirm'd the Pope in his Reſolution, aſſuring him that the <hi>French</hi> wou'd probably conſent, that <hi>Giuliano de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici</hi> ſhou'd have the Dutchy <hi>Milan,</hi> if they were repell'd in the Tryal they were going to make for its Recovery.</p>
            <pb n="378" facs="tcp:53621:232"/>
            <p>Upon this Suppoſition, the Pope ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> wou'd ſuffer him to act againſt <hi>Sforza,</hi> nay, and wou'd ſecond him too, in caſe he wou'd divide, with them, the ſpoils of this Prince. Then made he the Propoſal of it to the Miniſters of <hi>Spain,</hi> who pretended to approve it, tho' they thought it ridiculous, becauſe their preſent Intereſt was only to hinder <hi>France</hi> from re-inſtating it ſelf in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> which they ſaw plainly the Pope wou'd oppoſe, with all his Might, as long as he ſhou'd Cocker in his Mind, the Chimerical aggrandiſement of his Brother. Thus the Pope, after having ſounded his Confederates, became fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that there was nothing more to do to enter <hi>Milan,</hi> than a well managing <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſſa.</hi> He did him all the Favours that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> can grant, without its coſting him any thing; I mean, that he gave him Benefices for his Brothers, and for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. It was thought <hi>Fregoſſa</hi> wou'd have yielded to ſuch ſolid Teſtimonies of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, if it had come ſooner in the Popes Head to gain him. But he was already too far engag'd with the <hi>French,</hi> and only wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their coming, to declare himſelf in their behalf. In the mean while, he us'd all ſuch Demonſtrations, as ſerv'd to keep the Pope in good Humour, and ſo craftily
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:53621:232"/>deluded him, that the Pope did not think he had a better Friend in all <hi>Italy,</hi> than <hi>Fregoſſa;</hi> witneſs the Plan which his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Communicated to him, of all the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> meant to do for the diſputing the Paſſage of the <hi>Alpes. Giuliano de Medici</hi> was Elected General of their Troops, and advanc'd as far as <hi>Florence,</hi> the place appointed for the Rendezvous of thoſe of the Church. But as he was there preparing a ſtately Equipage, and ſuitable to the Soveraignty he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go take Poſſeſſion of, as ſoon as he ſhou'd have repell'd the <hi>French,</hi> a Malign Feaver Checkmated him, and bereft him of Life in ſix Weeks ſpace. His Death did not Chill the Popes Ambition, it only chang'd its Object. <hi>Alfonſina,</hi> his Siſter-in-Law, had already long complain'd, that he did nought for young <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> his Eldeſt Brother's only Son, and Head of his Houſe. His Holineſs had ever excus'd himſelf upon the particular Obligations he had to Eſtabliſh <hi>Giuliano</hi> before all things; but <hi>Giuliano</hi> was no more; <hi>Lorenzo</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready twenty years old, well made of his Perſon, and ſhew'd much Inclination for Arms.</p>
            <p>The Pope Conferr'd on him <hi>Giuliano</hi>'s Place, in what regarded the Command of the Troops of the League, but he had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:53621:233"/>the Experience nor the Virtues neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for ſuch an Employ. His Genius was too ſlow, and ſo little capable of diſ-entangling him from Pleaſures, when once in them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd, that he was ſtill in the Arms of the Courtezans of <hi>Florence,</hi> when <hi>Trimulée,</hi> who Commanded the Van-guard of the <hi>French.</hi> Army, having caus'd a Peaſant of <hi>Piemont</hi> to ſhew him a Path, by which the light Cavalry might croſs the Mountains of <hi>Nice,</hi> he acquainted <hi>la Palice</hi> with it, who took <hi>Proſpero Colonna,</hi> in <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> and diſperſt all the Forces deſign'd to defend the Inlet of <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There needed no more to unhinge the Pope, and make him loſe Courage. He ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd the <hi>French</hi> were already in <hi>Milan,</hi> and diſpatcht away a Man of Credence, to Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate with them. This Agent fell unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily into the Arms of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who diſtruſting his Journey, treated him as a Spy, that they might have a Pretence to rifle him. They took from him his Inſtruction, and uncipher'd it; they thereby penetrated into the Popes Deſigns, and not willing to be the Victims of his Accommodation with <hi>France,</hi> caus'd their Army to ſtop near <hi>Trebia,</hi> when advancing in long Marches, to join the Forces of the Confederates.</p>
            <pb n="381" facs="tcp:53621:233"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> who was at laſt depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Florence,</hi> upon the rumour of <hi>Proſporo Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna</hi>'s being taken, and had put himſelf into <hi>Plaiſanza</hi> with very brave Troops, preſs'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to come and join him, or to appoint him a place in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> that might ſerve him for Rendezvous: But <hi>Cardona,</hi> who commanded them, made no poſitive anſwer, under colour that it wou'd be expoſing his Quality of Vice-Roy of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> to be in the ſame Camp with <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> whom he ſhou'd be oblig'd to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, as being General of the League. Thus <hi>Cardona</hi> not budging, and <hi>Lorenzo de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici</hi> not finding himſelf ſtrong enough to March, without the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> the <hi>Suizzars</hi> remain'd alone in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs they pretended to defend it, and their Courage augmenting proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, as their Allies diminiſht, they with great firmneſs expected the <hi>French,</hi> and fought them at <hi>Marignan.</hi> They loſt ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand Men in this Action, and their heat of Liver being diſſipated by this blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they abandoned the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> with the Field of Battel to the Conquerours, and their Retreat made the <hi>Spaniards</hi> decamp, in haſte, from near <hi>Trebia,</hi> to return into the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> wou'd have defeated
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:53621:234"/>them with ſmall difficulty, if they had purſu'd them, but the Pope amuſed them by this Artifice.</p>
            <p>He diſpatch'd to the Moſt Chriſtian King, the moſt cunning of his Emiſſaries, call'd <hi>Lodovico Canole;</hi> and to diſpoſe his Majeſty to receive his Agent the better, he wrote to <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> to retire out of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Plaiſanza,</hi> and to the Inhabitants of thoſe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to go preſent their Keys to the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Canole</hi> found the King already weary of the abode of <hi>Italy,</hi> and propos'd to him the Interview of <hi>Bologna,</hi> as the only means to haſten his return into <hi>France.</hi> The King ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted it, without making reflection, that his Enemies only ſought thereby to gain time. The Pope arriv'd firſt at <hi>Bologna,</hi> to receive there the King, who came thither two days after, accompani'd with eight thouſand Horſe. Chancellor <hi>du Prat</hi> drew up there the Plan of the Concordate, with Secretary <hi>Graffis;</hi> and this is the only particularity I relate of this Intrigue, becauſe I have found no other that has eſcap'd the knowledge of the famous Monſieur <hi>de Puits;</hi> and beſides, the Arch-biſhop <hi>d'Aix-Genebrard</hi> had made a Treatiſe of it, which paſſes for <hi>Anecdote.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then was brought upon the Board a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a League between the Holy See and
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:53621:234"/>
               <hi>France;</hi> but the Pope had his Anſwer ready. He let the King know, that it became nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Gravity, nor Decorum of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Pontife, to break his Word with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for the ſixteen Months that he was bound to remain ſtill united with them, but that this time ſhou'd be no ſooner expir'd, but that he wou'd do all that his Majeſty ſhould deſire of him. The King was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd with this Excuſe, becauſe that being ſtill young, and without Experience, he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd that he ſhou'd never be ſoon enough in <hi>France,</hi> to receive the Applauſes, which the Victory of <hi>Marignan,</hi> and the reduction of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> had deſerved.</p>
            <p>Thus ended the Interview of <hi>Bologna;</hi> and a Body may ſay, that the Pope preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by Cunning, his Predeceſſors Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to the Holy See, and the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> His Holineſs wou'd needs paſs through <hi>Florence,</hi> in his way to <hi>Rome;</hi> and as his Country-Men had then improved Architecture, Sculpture, and Painting, to the higheſt point they cou'd at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they made him an entrance that will never have the like. <hi>Giacomo de Sandro</hi> made the Triumphal Arch of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Gate, where, all that Fancy cou'd add to Hiſtory, was ſo happily employ'd, that the Pope, who underſtood Painting admirably
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:53621:235"/>well, upon his viewing it, fell into a kind of Extaſie, from whence they had much a do to rouze him, to get him advance. The Work was ſo much the more ſingular, that <hi>Baccio de Monte Lupo</hi> had had a hand in it, as well as <hi>Sandro.</hi> But as their manner was quite different, eaſie was it to diſtinguiſh, to their very leaſt ſtrokes, and to render to each the Juſtice he deſerved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Giuliano de Taſſo</hi> had made another Arch before the Church of St. <hi>Felice,</hi> whoſe Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was no leſs Charming for its oddneſs, than for its Beauty. As if this had not been bus'neſs enough for him, he had undertaken and finiſht ſo lively and capricious a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the Adventures of <hi>Romulus,</hi> that the Pope went thither two or three times to ſee it. <hi>Antony de St. Gal</hi> made, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place of the Lords, an <hi>Octogone</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe Deſign was new. And the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, which <hi>Bandivelli</hi> put in the Gallery of the Palace, cou'd not be better proportion'd, notwithſtanding his enormous bigneſs.</p>
            <p>The Triumphal Arch of <hi>Gràmaccis,</hi> between the Abby and Palace of <hi>Podeſta,</hi> expreſs'd the Marriage of the Arts with the Virtues, and that of <hi>Roſſo a Canto di Biſſierre</hi> was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous for the diverſity in its Figures. In a word, <hi>André del Sarto</hi> diſguis'd the <hi>Facciata de Santa Maria del Fiore</hi> ſo, as that ſhe ſeemed
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:53621:235"/>all Marble, by a kind of Maſtic appli'd upon Cloath, which <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> had invented.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alfonſina deg l'Orſini,</hi> reſiding at <hi>Florence,</hi> took advantage of the good humour, the ſight of ſo many inimitable Objects had crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Pope, to excite him to the aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſement of her Son. She had long already ty'd the Dutchy of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino</hi> as a Prey; and ſhe tormented her Brother-in-Law, to give the inveſtitute thereof to young <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> upon the ſcore that this Dutchy was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely for his Bienſeance, and a Neighbour of the State of <hi>Florence.</hi> But ſhe had never been able to obtain any thing in <hi>Giuliano de Medici</hi>'s Life-time, becauſe he had ever op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd whoever attempted on that ſide, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had an abhorrence to the Conſenting to ſo viſible an Injuſtice, or that he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded acknowledgment to a Prince, who had giv'n him a Retreat, during his Exile. But no ſooner were his Eyes clos'd, than that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſina deg l'Orſini</hi> redoubled her Inſtances. The Pope had too much Wit, than to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the injury he ſhou'd do his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Scandal he ſhou'd give the Chriſtian World, by diverſting one of his Vaſſals without Cauſe. He reſiſted ſome time, but at length two things prevailed with him to give way. The firſt, His
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:53621:236"/>Siſter-in-Law's extream Importunity, who left him not one moment at quiet, till ſhe had got him to fall out with the Duke <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bino.</hi> And the ſecond, That the Duke had not been careful to improve his Friendſhip before he was Pope, nor ſo much as ſince. And now follow Circumſtances relating to this point, which well merit being known.</p>
            <p>I have already remark'd, that he had us'd his utmoſt efforts to obſtruct the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci's</hi> from being reſtor'd in <hi>Florence,</hi> but this was not his greateſt Crime. He had fil'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the Account, namely, that being General of the Church, and by conſequence bound to purſue its Intereſts, he had never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſent into <hi>France,</hi> the Count <hi>Baltha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar Caſtillonne,</hi> for the negotiating there an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation apart, in Execution of which, he had hindred the Souldiers of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Army, from paſſing upon his Territories, for fear of their being at the Battel of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna,</hi> and had deny'd giving paſſage to thoſe that had been beaten there: Moreover, at the laſt irruption of the <hi>French</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> he had accepted the Lieutenancy of the Troop of the League, under <hi>Giuliano de Medici</hi> appointed General: Yet when ſickneſs had hindered <hi>Giuliano</hi> from Command in them, and that young <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had been put into his room, the Duke <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus'd
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:53621:236"/>to ſerve under him, and alledg'd, for excuſe, his not having conſented to obey <hi>Giu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liano,</hi> than on the ſcore of Friendſhip, which gave him reaſon to believe, that he wou'd have ſhar'd the Generalſhip with him; but that having no peculiar engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> and their humours, on the contrary, being incompatible, it was to be feared they wou'd not paſs two days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without a Broil and Diſturbance.</p>
            <p>This Carriage had extraordinarily morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd the Pope, in that the Duke <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino,</hi> ſhew'd a two viſible Contempt of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew: Yet he wou'd not have dared to complain, if the Duke had not added Injury to Diſdain, by detaining in his ſtate, the brave Companies of Ordonnance, that had been levi'd, inſtead of ſending them at leaſt to the Rendezvous, ſince he went not thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himſelf. This is what he was upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with, in the Manifeſt publiſh'd againſt him, when War was declared upon him. It was no difficult matter for <hi>Lorenzo de Ceri,</hi> who commanded the Army of the Church to deſpoil him; becauſe that not having at that time any Souldiers to defend his State, and ſuſpecting the principal aim was upon his Perſon, becauſe his Death wou'd have ſecur'd the Dutchy of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi> to the Houſe of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici;</hi> he durſt not Coop himſelf up in any
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:53621:237"/>Place, for fear of being immediately there inveſted, and ſecuring what he had moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, accepted the azyle offer'd him by the Duke of <hi>Mantoua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pope being fluſht with the eaſineſs of this Conqueſt, undertook another, which coſt him as little trouble, tho' it failed little of proving fatal to him. <hi>Pandolfo Petrucci,</hi> who Commanded at <hi>Sienna,</hi> had afforded him a Retreat, during his Exile, and his Son the Cardinal had ſerved for an Inſtrument, to advance him to the Supream Dignity of the Church, by forming the Faction of the young Cardinals, who obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd having any other Pope than him; yet the Pope choſe rather to fall into the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ingratitude, than loſe the occaſion that was offer'd, of joyning the ſtate of <hi>Sienna</hi> to that of <hi>Florence:</hi> But he went not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it at firſt by main force, he contented himſelf with kindling in <hi>Sienna</hi> a Sedition, which, at length, conſtrain'd <hi>Petrucci</hi> to depart thence, and put in his room his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemy, devoted to the Houſe of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Republick of <hi>Lucca</hi> had not been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter treated, had not the Emperour, <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> the Firſt, been in <hi>Italy</hi> with an Army, wherein were reckon'd above ſixty thouſand Souldiers, with deſign to chaſe the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="386" facs="tcp:53621:237"/>out of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> ſtopp'd the Popes Progreſſes. His Holineſſes Troops were very brave and ſprightly, he had promis'd them to the Moſt Chriſtian King, who had demanded them with ſo much the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, in that he cou'd not ſo ſuddenly ſend into the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> Forces ſufficient to diſpute the entrance of it with the <hi>Germans.</hi> But the Pope judged the time of decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelf not to be yet come; he re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd his Troops, and caus'd them to march into <hi>Lombardy,</hi> under <hi>Bibiana</hi>'s Conduct, who then poſſeſſed all the Confidence of his Maſter. The ſecret inſtruction that was giv'n him, boar, that he ſhou'd reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd, at the firſt, with being a Spectator of the Tragedy, then going to be acted: but that upon the unravelling of the piece, he ſhou'd not too long defer throwing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the Party that Fortune favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſo he might boaſt of having giv'n the laſt mortal blow to the Conquered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bibiana</hi> was a good Player in all kinds, yet he cou'd not ſhuffle ſo cunningly, but that his Game was diſcover'd. The Emperour advanc'd, without Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, as far as the City of <hi>Milan,</hi> where the Conſtable of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and the Mareſchal <hi>de Trimulee,</hi> were reſolved to ſuſtain the Siege with their beſt Troops. The <hi>Germans</hi>
               <pb n="390" facs="tcp:53621:238"/>had laid it, in hopes the Citizens wou'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for them, and conſtrain the <hi>French</hi> Garriſon to Capitulate. But <hi>Trimulee</hi> made the Souldiers live with ſo much moderation, that they gave not their Hoſts any occaſion of Diſcontent. Thus the Siege ſpinning out into length, the moſt Chriſtian King's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters had opportunity to debauch <hi>Staff</hi> and <hi>Puts,</hi> two of the principal Officers of the eighteen thouſand <hi>Suizzars,</hi> that compos'd the Flow'r of the Emperours Infantry. Theſe two Leaders, after having made ſure of their Companions, went to <hi>Maximilian</hi>'s Tent, and demanded of him the Arrears that were owing to their Nation. <hi>Maximilian</hi> was ſo prodigal, that he never had Money in his Coffers; but, in recompence, he was ſo ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, that his Creditors had much ado to deny him time. His Careſſes, however, cou'd not in the leaſt prevail upon the two <hi>Suiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars;</hi> on the contrary, they put them into a Paſſion, and made them let fly ſuch words, as caſt <hi>Maximilian</hi> into a pannique Fear. He imagined they had contriv'd to deliver him up to the <hi>French,</hi> in the ſame manner they had formerly ſold <hi>Lodovico Sforza;</hi> and the horrour of ſuch a Treatment being ſtronger than his Reaſon, he determin'd of a ſudden to fly away towards <hi>Trent,</hi> and did ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, without being follow'd by more
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:53621:238"/>than his Domeſticks. His Army, thus wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Head, disbanded of it ſelf, and the <hi>French</hi> being thus deliver'd, bent their thoughts to take revenge on the Pope, who had fail'd them in time of need.</p>
            <p>They helped the <hi>Venetians</hi> to recover the places, which the City of <hi>Cambray</hi> had taken from them; and the Garriſons which eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luated thoſe places, not knowing what to do, ſuffer'd themſelves to be perſuaded by a <hi>French</hi> Emiſſary, who advis'd them to ſide with the Duke <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino.</hi> To theſe were joyned diſown'd Troops, Collected from all Parts; and the Duke <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino</hi> placing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at their Head, lead them, with an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Expedition, before his Capital City. <hi>Giulio Vitelli</hi> Commanded therein a Garriſon of three thouſand Souldiers, for <hi>Lorenzo de Medici;</hi> but the Women and their Children had no ſooner heard of the Duke's being at their Gates, but the Sedition taking fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo great in a quarter of an hours ſpace, that <hi>Vitelli,</hi> in ſpight of all his endeavours, was forc'd to Capitulate to go out with the White Staff.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> receiv'd the tydings of this alteration at <hi>Rome,</hi> whither he had brought back his Uncle's Troops; he caus'd them to march, with all diligence, towards <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbria,</hi> and met with the Duke of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi>
               <pb n="392" facs="tcp:53621:239"/>at the paſſage of a River. He might have defeated the half of his Men, if he wou'd have been content with a Demi-Victory; but as he had a great advantage o're <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino</hi>'s Army, in what related to the Number and Diſcipline of his Souldiers, it made him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inclin'd to wait for the occaſion of giving him a total defeat, but never after cou'd he meet with ſuch an opportunity, for that the Duke <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino,</hi> who had many of the parts of a great Captain, whatever is ſaid of him by <hi>Guie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiardin,</hi> ſtood upon his Defence in the Water, with a Pike in his hand; and holding firm with his choiceſt Forces, while the reſt filed off behind, ſaved all to him belonging, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'n to the very Baggage, and wou'd ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nothing more afterwards, and reſted ſatisfy'd with having recover'd his State. Nevertheleſs there was a Rencounter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> advancing too far, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd ſo dangerous a Wound in his Head, as compell'd him to cauſe himſelf to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> that he might be the better look'd to.</p>
            <p>His Army had no ſooner ſeen him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, but that it disbanded of it ſelf; and the Pope foreſeeing his Reputation upon the point of being loſt, if thus fruſtrated in his Deſigns upon <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> he us'd all poſſible means to accompliſh it in the manner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:53621:239"/>He knew the Duke <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino</hi> had not a fund to pay his Troops, and that he was ev'n indebted whole Muſters to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Regiments of <hi>Suarez</hi> and <hi>Maldonet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe two Colonels had ſufficiently utter'd their minds, that they only ſerv'd for Money, as to be deem'd capable of an Infidelity; and ſeveral Emiſſaries had order to feel their Pulſes. In a ſhort time they agreed upon the Reward to be giv'n them, for delivering up the Duke <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino;</hi> and for fear of their failing in their word, his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſes Emiſſaries, without their Participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, treated with a Captain of Horſe, of the ſame Nation, <hi>Cabille,</hi> by name, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to aſſaſſinate the Duke, at the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view that ſhou'd be made. Either th'one or t'other of theſe two Conſpiracies cou'd not not have miſs'd of ſpeeding, if the Duke of <hi>Atria,</hi> having been made privy, had not revealed them to the Duke <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino,</hi> who ſhew'd much Judgment and Courage in ſo ſurprizing a Conjuncture. He aſſembl'd his Army under Colour, of leading it to an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, at that very inſtant to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Thoſe of the Conſpiracy ſtood in their Ranks, and the Duke having perceiv'd them, made an Eloquent Diſcourſe, with deſign to reproach them with their perfidiouſneſs. He related all the Circumſtances of the Plot,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:53621:240"/>he read Letters written with their own Hands, which Convicted them to all Intents, and demanded with a fierce and reſolute tone, that thoſe who had no ſhare in their Crimes, ſhou'd do him Juſtice.</p>
            <p>This Harangue produc'd ſuch a hurly bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Souldiers minds that heard it, that the Accomplices might have had time to eſcape, if they had liſted; but as they were reſolute Fellows, inſtead of being ſeiz'd with Fear, at the knowledge of their Plot's being diſcover'd, they made haſte to execute this their enterprize; they fell to uniting their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments into a Body, and a ſurrounding the place where the Duke was mounted, but they found themſelves environ'd with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry they did not in the leaſt diſtruſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Federigo Boſſolo,</hi> a Prince of the Houſe of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> who Commanded this Horſe, had quitted the Pope's Service, becauſe <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> had taken from him the General Lieutenancy of his Army, which had been conferr'd on him by the Pope, He fear'd falling into his hands, as knowing <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s humour to be implacable, when it had been once provok'd; and this reaſon engag'd him to ſave the Duke <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino.</hi> In a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did he rally his Troops, ſpurr'd and fired them with Honour, animated them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Criminals, and perſuaded them
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:53621:240"/>to ſtop 'em. And the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Infantry ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were not ſtrong enough to defend their Colonels, deliver'd them up, and the Horſe forthwith ſhot, and put them to the Sword.</p>
            <p>A Month after the Pope ran the ſame flanger the Duke <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino</hi> had avoided. I have already noted <hi>Petrucci</hi> to have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd <hi>Sienna,</hi> tho' his Son, the Cardinal had Contributed more than the reſt, to his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes Election. The Father ſupported his Exile with ſufficient conſtancy; but the Son being reſolv'd, at any rate, to be reveng'd, did, for a long while, carry a Dagger under his Robes, with intent to kill the Pope in full Conſiſtory, whither he came without Guards, as imagining it wou'd be eaſie for him to eſcape through the <hi>Corſi,</hi> before they knew of the perpetration of the Fact. But he ſince chang'd his Mind, as to the place; and whether his Heart fail'd him at the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, or that he found more Obſtacles in it, than he had imagin'd, he choſe rather to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch the Pope, when a Hunting, where he ſometimes wandred ſo far from Company, that he expos'd his Perſon to the poſſibility of being ſtabb'd. But there needed ſo many Circumſtances to concur at the ſame time, to produce this opportunity, that it was neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected as ſoon as the former.</p>
            <pb n="396" facs="tcp:53621:241"/>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Petrucci</hi> had contriv'd, in the third place, to form a Faction in the Sacred Colledge; and the firſt he ſifted was Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Adrian de Corneto,</hi> who fell under the deluſion of the moſt amazing Prediction, that has been heard of, ſince Sooth-ſayers were in the World. This Prelate was born upon the ſhoar of the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Sea, in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whence he borrow'd his Name. His Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were ſo poor, as conſtrain'd 'em to put him out to Service, but he had the good luck of meeting with a Maſter, that caus'd him to ſtudy, and furniſh'd him with the means to paſs thro' all the Eccleſiaſtical Dignities, without being otherwiſe indebted for his Fortune than to the Charity of the Author of his Education, and to his own Merit. Not long afore had he been to reviſit the place of his Nativity, where knowing a Magician to be in the Mountains of the <hi>Appenine,</hi> he had the Curioſity to try, whether there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny certainty in his Predictions. To him went he in a diſguiſed Garb, and conſulted him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſome Perſons of his Acquaintance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe adventures he was as well inform'd of as his own. The Wizzard gave him ſuch Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent anſwers, as produc'd him the occaſion of ſpeaking of himſelf. He ſhew'd him his Horoſcope, without telling him whoſe it was and askt him what wou'd become of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:53621:241"/>born under ſuch a Conſtellation? <hi>If it is a Man,</hi> (reply'd the Magician) <hi>he will at leaſt be Cardinal, and if it is a Woman, ſhe will come very near the Throne, if ſhe does not aſcend it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Cardinal <hi>Corneto</hi> deſir'd to know no more upon his own Article, and ſlily turning his Diſcourſe, engag'd the Magician to ſpeak of the Pope. The Magician did aſſure he wou'd dye young, and of an unexpected Death. Then the Cardinal was tempted to enquire after the Fate of his Succeſſour: And the Devil only waiting for this, to puniſh him for his Curioſity, told him, thro' the Wizzard's Mouth, That the Conclave that ſhould be held after Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th's Death, ſhou'd be long and factious, but that at laſt they wou'd Elect a Cardinal, named <hi>Adrian;</hi> that this <hi>Adrian</hi> ſhou'd be of very low Birth, and wou'd gradually mount to all the Dignities of the Church, without any Recommendation; and thro' his own ſufficiency; that he wou'd be ſixty years of Age at the Moment of his Exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not provided with any Benefice.</p>
            <p>It muſt needs be own'd, that the Devil was never more ingenuous to deceive, than in this occaſion. All theſe Circumſtances ſuited admirably well with Cardinal <hi>Corneto,</hi> and with him only in the Sacred Colledge.
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:53621:242"/>He was of a much lower Birth than all the other Cardinals; he had mounted thro' all the Degrees inferiour to that Dignity; he had been Chaplain, Canon, Dean and Biſhop, without ever having had two Benefices at a time; he paſt, without Contradiction, for the Learnedeſt Member of the Conſiſtory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had never made his Court to any Man for Preferment, no, not ſo much as to his firſt Patron: Fortune went to ſeek him in his Chamber, and at his very Books. Thoſe who had done him good, had had regard only to his Merit; for as to outward advantages, he was not poſſeſs'd of any. In a word, his Name was <hi>Adrian;</hi> and this laſt Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Sooth-ſayers Prediction, ſeem'd to point him out, as well as that of his Age, ſeeing he wanted but three Months, of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving accompliſht his ſixty'th year.</p>
            <p>He took leave of the Magician, more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd than he went thither, but was much more pleas'd when, after his return to <hi>Rome.</hi> Cardinal <hi>Petrucci</hi> ſollicited him to enter into the Conſpiracy. He imagin'd that by this means it was, that Deſtiny began to labour for his Exaltation, and believ'd it ſo much the more ſtrongly, as that the time drew near, that had been fore-told him, and that he had the hint of the Pope's being to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht after an unexpected manner. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:53621:242"/>as Cardinal <hi>Corneto</hi> was conſiderate and wary in all his Actions, he wou'd enter into no poſitive Engagement, nor give any Token that might ſerve to Convict him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion. He contented himſelf with aſſuring Cardinal <hi>Petrucci,</hi> that he wou'd not reveal his Enterprize to any body, nor wou'd he go about to croſs it.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Sauli,</hi> who was afterwards wheedled to be an Accomplice, took the like Courſe, but out of another conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he had promis'd his Suffrage to <hi>Bibiand,</hi> for Cardinal <hi>de Medici,</hi> upon the hopes <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biana</hi> had giv'n him of the firſt vacant Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice, which he ſhou'd think worthy of his acceptance; and <hi>Bibiana</hi> pretended Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>de Medici</hi> had ratifi'd the Promiſe, yet it had not any effect; and tho' the firſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice, having been diſpos'd of to <hi>Giulio de Medici,</hi> Commander of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> this did not offend <hi>Sauli,</hi> as not thinking it ſtrange, that the Pope had broke his word with him, in conſideration of the only Perſon of the Houſe of <hi>Medici,</hi> that was an Eccleſiaſtick, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for the Province of Cardinal Nephew; but when other Rich Arch-biſhopricks ſell vacant, and he had demanded them, and yet were refus'd him, and conferr'd on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who had indeed ſerv'd in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave, but not ſo uſefully as he, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:53621:243"/>piqu'd; and Cardinal <hi>Petrucci</hi> ſo improv'd this Reſentment of <hi>Sauli</hi>'s, for his being deny'd, that he agreed to the Revenge that was brooding in his behalf, without his medling in the matter.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Riario</hi> was the third that entred into the Plot, thro' a Motive of hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Houſe of <hi>Medici,</hi> which laſted ſince the danger he had run at <hi>Florence,</hi> when the <hi>Pazzi</hi>'s Conſpiracy broke forth, and through a Sentiment, common enough among th' <hi>Italians,</hi> that the Pope, how kind ſoever in his behaviour to him, wou'd never forget his Uncle's Death, nor his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Wound, to which <hi>Riario</hi> had at leaſt ſerv'd for a Pretext. Moreover he promis'd himſelf to be Elected Pope, ſince, being Dean of the Cardinals, and having more Benefices than any other, to diſtribute among them, they wou'd give him then Votes; beſides, his having brought himſelf into Credit at <hi>Rome,</hi> by his vaſt Expence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by the magnificent Palace he had there caus'd to be built.</p>
            <p>The laſt was Cardinal <hi>Soderini,</hi> who ſuffer'd himſelf to be cajoll'd with the hopes of re-inſtating his Brother in the perpetual Dictatorſhip of <hi>Florence,</hi> which ſeem'd to him eaſie, when the Pope was once dead, and that Cardinal <hi>Petrucci</hi>'s Father ſhou'd
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:53621:243"/>have recover'd his Authority in <hi>Sienna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Conſpiracy being thus formed, the meaſures they took to Execute it were as follow. They made ſure of a famous Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator of <hi>Italy,</hi> call'd <hi>Verſelli,</hi> a Man lucky in Curing Wounds, and handled them ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licately, that he hardly gave any pain, ſuch ſubtilty had he in his Fingers, and pleaſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the performance of his Profeſſion. This Fellow was extraordinarily Debaucht, and delighted in committing the blackeſt Actions, but he did them with ſo many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, that they had never been able to ſurprize him, and his Reputation was whole as yet. His principal Talent lay for Venerial Diſtempers, and this it was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd him into Cardinal <hi>Petrucci</hi>'s Familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He propos'd to him poyſoning the Pope, by a way that cou'd not be diſcover'd. For the better making it underſtood, I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat that the Pope had had an Impoſthume, which burſt, but whoſe Wound was not wholly clos'd; and there did remain a hole, thro' which the matter gleeted from time to time, either that the Diſeaſe had been too great to be wholly Cured, or that the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians had judg'd, that Nature ought to be ſuffer'd to diſcharge it ſelf that way, which a had made of it ſelf; and indeed the Pope dy'd as ſoon as it clos'd. Wherefore he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:53621:244"/>a very able Chyrurgeon, that ſhou'd pay him conſtant attendance; and as the Bands were to be chang'd as often as he was dreſs'd, nothing was more eaſie than to poyſon them, without its being perceiv'd, becauſe the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, wherewith they wou'd be cover'd, wou'd hinder the Venom from being ſeen.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Petrucci</hi> approv'd the Invention, and ſet a going his Intrigues, to work the Popes privy Chyrurgeon out of his Place, ſo to put <hi>Vercelli</hi> in his room. The thing did not ſeem difficult; for beſides that the Pope's Chyrurgeon was none of the ableſt; and that they had it from Perſons well inform'd, that his Holineſs ſometimes complain'd of the roughneſs of his Hand, he had the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to diſpleaſe ſuch of the Servants, as were moſt in their Patrons favour. And, in effect, <hi>Giulio Blanci,</hi> the Chamberlain, took upon him to procure him his Conſent, at the firſt ſollicitation made him, by a Man truſty to Cardinal <hi>Petrucci;</hi> and the Cardinals who had the moſt intimacy with the Pope, did aſſure, that there was nothing more eaſie, than the bringing it about. The Cardinal Nephew, tho' a Man of great ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of Wit, and a pretender to Sagacity, yet was made a Cully; for they induc'd him to make the propoſal of it to his Uncle, without knowing its tendency. But the
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:53621:244"/>Pope ſhew'd more firmneſs on that ſide, than was expected; for he anſwer'd, that tho' his Chyrurgeon were ſtill more uncapable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skillful, yet wou'd he keep him, becauſe he cou'd not reſolve upon diſcovering himſelf before a new Chyrurgeon, and concluded with ſaying, That he had rather endure his own, than change.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, they did not deſpair of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king His Holineſs condeſcend to it, at the long run; and I do not queſtion, but that he wou'd, at length, have comply'd with their deſires, had they perſever'd in their Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. But while they were contriving new means to introduce <hi>Verſelli</hi> into the Pope's Family, news came to <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Duke <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino,</hi> after having quaſht the Factions of his Army, Conducted it to <hi>Sienna,</hi> in order to re-inveſt <hi>Petrucci</hi> in that Government, in hopes that this re-inſtation wou'd help him to chaſe the Houſe of <hi>Medici</hi> from <hi>Florence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pope, ſeeing the Conſequences of this March, dreaded loſing what he had moſt dear; and ſuppoſing that the Duke <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino</hi>

<pb n="404" facs="tcp:53621:245"/>had him ſo narrowly watcht, that a Letter was intercepted, which he wrote to <hi>Antonio Nini,</hi> his Secretary in the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> They found it all in Cypher; and this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance augmented the Pope's Suſpicion and Curioſity; for without this it had been ſlighted. The Art of Decyphering was not yet in uſe, and the Pope cou'd only learn from <hi>Nini</hi> the tenour of the Letter. His Holineſs ſent for <hi>Nini;</hi> and he, inſtead of ſetting a good Face on't, gave ſo many tokens of Surprize and Fear, that the Pope preſs'd him the more; and as he continu'd obſtinate, denying Complyance with his Holineſs, he threatned to put him upon the Rack. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd then ſo unhing'd, that he gave occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to execute upon him, what had been on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propos'd to fright him; the Inſtruments of Torture were brought, and <hi>Nini</hi> had no ſooner ſeen them, but that he diſcover'd the place where he had hid the Cypher, which Cardinal <hi>Petrucci</hi> had left with him. Thus other Myſteries came to light than thoſe they hunted after.</p>
            <p>Not that the Conſpiracy was, in this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo plainly coucht, as to be underſtood, but ſo many Particularities were there, which ſerv'd to hint it, that the Pope was advis'd nevertheleſs to put <hi>Nini</hi> to the Rack, tho' he had deliver'd the Cypher.

Inquiry was made, in what place <hi>Verſelli</hi> reſided at that time, and they were inform'd, that the <hi>Gonfalionere</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> call'd <hi>Gori,</hi> had ſent for him to Cure him of a ſecret Malady: This Magiſtrate was devoted to the Houſe of <hi>Medici;</hi> and the Pope, who truſted in him, ſent him word, that he might make uſe of <hi>Verſelli;</hi> but that he ſhou'd cauſe him to be watcht with ſo much diligence, as that he might not eſcape out of his reach, that ſo he might be able to reſtore him in due time, and when he requir'd him at his hands.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſion was difficult to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, becauſe <hi>Verſelli</hi> was to be ſecur'd, without his knowing of it himſelf. But <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi> was ſo dextrous, that he fullfill'd his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, by cauſing him to come and lodge at his Houſe, and by furniſhing him with ſufficient Recreations in his own Family, ſo
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:53621:246"/>as not to be oblig'd to go ſeek them elſe-where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What made the Pope act in this manner was, that he had a mind to attract Cardinal <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trucci</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> a thing not to be thought of, if it appear'd that he had ſecured <hi>Verſelli,</hi> by reaſon that the Cardinal wou'd inſtantly have harbour'd a ſuſpicion of the Conſpiracy's being diſcover'd. Thus, while <hi>Verſelli</hi> was unwittingly a Priſoner at <hi>Florence,</hi> the Craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt Emiſſary of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſent to the Cardinal, to prevail with him to come thither. The Pretext was, that the Pope ſeeing his Nephew wounded, and being not able to hinder his Troops from disbanding, or to debauch thoſe of the Duke <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino,</hi> his Holineſs was no longer in a Condition to maintain his Authority in <hi>Sienna,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to re-eſtabliſh <hi>Petrucci</hi> with Decorum in that Town, before he ſeem'd to do it out of Compulſion. This Fiction was ſo conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the poſture of Affairs at that time, that Cardinal <hi>Petrucci,</hi> with all his ſhrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs took it for truth; and the Pope having ſent to him thereupon, that he only waited his Return, to contrive with him the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by which Old <hi>Petrucci</hi> was to return into <hi>Sienna.</hi> He ſuffer'd himſelf to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to take a Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to preſent himſelf at the Popes Anti-Chamber, where he was ſeiz'd and clapt immediately
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:53621:246"/>into a Dungeon. A Courier was forthwith diſpatcht away to <hi>Florence,</hi> where <hi>Verſelli</hi> was nabb'd playing at Dice, and, under a good Guard, brought away to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Cardinal <hi>Petrucci</hi>'s Detention cou'd not be ſecret, the Pope had giv'n Order to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Conſiſtory, as ſoon as he had ſet Foot in the Palace, and all the Cardinals, then at <hi>Rome,</hi> met accordingly, thinking their Convention was to regulate the affairs of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna.</hi> But they were very much ſtartled, to ſee the Pope's ſevere Countenance, and to hear his Holineſſes Speech, which cou'd not be more ſpirited, and more touching. He exagerated the Benefits he had heaped upon the Sacred Colledge, for the making them the better conceive the Ingratitude. Then he ſpoke of a Conſpiracy framed againſt his Life, by ſome Cardinals, without further explaining his Mind. He concluded with offering to pardon them, if they own'd the Crime at that very inſtant, and askt his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in the preſence of their Fraternity; and on the contrary, proteſting to abandon them to the utmoſt rigours of the ſecular Arm, if they neglected the moment he now granted them of Clemency.</p>
            <p>Cardinals <hi>Soderini</hi> and <hi>Corneto</hi> roſe up from their Seats, and proſtrated themſelves at the Popes Feet, who pardon'd them,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:53621:247"/>in conſideration of a Fine of ten thouſand Crowns each. This ſlight Contravention to his Word, joyn'd to the ſigns of Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which appear'd in ſpight of him in his Face, made Cardinal <hi>Corneto</hi> judge it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, to truſt it only with reſerve. He went his ways home to ſhift his own emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency into a Diſguiſe, he put on the Garb of a Reaper, and ſlunk out of <hi>Rome</hi> thus ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly traveſty'd. He only beat the hoof by Night, till he came into his own Country, where he ſpent the reſt of his days in chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Forms and lurking Holes, ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was he ſtill perſuaded, notwithſtanding what had happen'd, that the effect of the Predictions I have mention'd, was inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Yet nothing of what he expected came to paſs, tho' the Magician had not told him one ſyllable of a Lye; for the Pope dy'd young, and of an unforeſeen Death. His Succeſſor, call'd <hi>Adrian,</hi> was the Son of a <hi>Flemming</hi> Bear-Brewer, that had rais'd his Fortune by his Learning, and poſſeſs'd but one Biſhoprick, which the Emperour, whoſe Tutor he had been, made him, as it were by force, accept of. All the Equivocation in the matter, and what deluded Cardinal <hi>Corneto,</hi> lay in <hi>Adrian</hi>'s not being yet of the Sacred Colledge, nor was he admitted of it, till the Promotion I am going to relate.</p>
            <pb n="409" facs="tcp:53621:247"/>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Soderini</hi> baniſh'd himſelf to <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> where he dy'd of Melancholly; and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Riario</hi> was neither made a Priſoner, nor under the proſecution of the Law, for the ſame Reaſon that had engag'd him in the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy: For the Pope being afraid that he ſhou'd be upbraided, with having reveng'd the ancient Quarrels of his Houſe, if he put to Death that Old Cardinal, who refus'd to ask his Pardon, contented himſelf with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting from him a hundred thouſand Crowns, on Condition he ſhou'd go abide in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples,</hi> where he had many Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
            <p>Thus Cordinal <hi>Sauli</hi> was the only Perſon taken into Cuſtody, at his going out of the Conſiſtory, and popt into a Dungeon. Thus far the Pope had acted in the Formalities, but ſo did he not continue; for inſtead of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioning Cardinals, for the Tryal of their Brothers, or nominating at leaſt two of them, to aſſiſt at drawing up the Malefactors Proceſſes, till it was time to give the Verdict in the wonted manner, the Sacred Colledge was interdicted the cognizance of it, and all the Accomplices were indifferently referr'd, without diſtinction of Quality, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Judges for Criminal Matters, who in a little time made them undergo a moſt ſevere Juſtice.</p>
            <pb n="410" facs="tcp:53621:248"/>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Petrucci,</hi> after having had his Members diſlocated on the Rack, was ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Dungeon, by an <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> call'd <hi>Orlando;</hi> and his Secretary <hi>Nini</hi> underwent the like Fate. The Operator <hi>Verſelli</hi> was drawn upon a Hurdle, Hang'd, his Fleſh tort with Pincers, and Quarter'd. Cardinal <hi>Sauli</hi> ran a riſque of his Life, if he had been leſs belov'd by the Popes Eldeſt Siſter. This fair Lady, who had an Almighty Credit o're her Brother's Diſpoſitions, threw her ſelf at his Feet, and wou'd not be got up, till ſhe had obtain'd <hi>Sauli</hi>'s Pardon.</p>
            <p>What abſolutely incens'd the Sacred Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge againſt the Pope was, That exceſſive Sums were exacted from the Parties that were Pardoned; for the way to puniſh Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in their Purſes, having not been as yet practis'd at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> they imagin'd that thoſe who were made to redeem their Lives were innocent, and only put into the Liſt of the Conſpirators, as being known to be Rich, and that the Pope's Coffers wanted Money to continue the War of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin.</hi> The Complaints the Cardinals made hereof, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated the Pope, and made him declare, he wou'd return no more into the Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſince it was only full of his Enemies, till ſuch time as he had introduc'd ſuch truſty Perſons in it, as that his Life might be there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:53621:248"/>ſafety: And, indeed, in a few days after he made a Promotion of one and thirty Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals. In this number eight there were of high Birth, the principal of whom, was <hi>Pompey Colonna,</hi> who prov'd the moſt dangerous Enemy, the Houſe of <hi>Medici</hi> has ever had; the reſt were divided; for ſome of 'em were barely indebted, for their Dignity, to their own Merit. Others had the Cap out of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as the Pope's Phyſician, who propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Son the Evening afore the Promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and his Holineſs excuſing it, upon his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already giv'n his Word to thirty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; the Phyſician reply'd to him, That as matters then ſtood, it wou'd not be thought the more ſtrange at <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was of one and thirty Perſons, than if it were juſt thirty. In ſhort, ſome there were that diſhonour'd the Sacred Purple, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been choſen out of low'r Motives.</p>
            <p>In the mean while Cardinal <hi>Bibiana,</hi> who Commanded what remain'd of the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Troops, in the Dutchy of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> call'd out for Succours. He had to do with an Enemy, who left him not at quiet; and his Souldiers, ſpighted at obeying a Man of ſuch low Extraction, as <hi>Bibiana,</hi> threatned to kill him, when he made them undergo the leaſt hardſhip. The Pope writ through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Europe</hi> for a re-inforcement, and at
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:53621:249"/>length ſet his Army again on foot, tho' it did not anſwer the hopes he had conceived of its Performances; for it was beaten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pizarro;</hi> and the Duke <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino</hi> was upon the point of ruining it to all Intents, when the Pope renew'd the deſign of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting o're his Troops. He employ'd for this purpoſe eight hundred thouſand Crowns, and the ſubtle <hi>Hugo de Montadez</hi> was his Inſtrument in this Project. This ſhrew'd <hi>Spaniard,</hi> if ever there was one, who began then only to enter upon the great Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, through which he puſht on ſince, by all manner of ways, did ſo well adjuſt his Intrigues, that the Duke <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino</hi> came to be abandoned on a ſudden, when he leaſt expected it: and all the Favour afforded him by the Deſerters, was leave to retire, and take along his Moveables and his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary.</p>
            <p>Then the Pope inveſted anew <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi> with the Dutchy of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> and ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, to give him in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage the Heireſs of the Houſe of <hi>Bologna,</hi> which was granted him. The Duke of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bania</hi> performed the Negotiation, and was promis'd, in Recompence, to be made Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the firſt League, that ſhou'd be fram'd againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> A ſtately entrance was made the Princeſs at <hi>Florence,</hi> where the
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:53621:249"/>Match was Conſummated; but ſhe dyed nine Months after in Child-bed, of <hi>Katharine</hi> of <hi>Medices,</hi> who is to be the principal Subject of this Work. The News of her Deceaſe was brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> in the time a Courier arriv'd, that with amazement fill'd the Town. He had been diſpatcht by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick of <hi>Venice,</hi> and brought news, that <hi>Selim</hi> had ſeiz'd on <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Syria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Augmentation of Pow'r diſpos'd the Chriſtian Princes, to form a League with the Pope, againſt the Infidels. The Plan that was drawn of it, cou'd neither be more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, nor more Magnificent. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour living then in a profound Peace, and, by Conſequence, able to bring on foot an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of Souldiers, was to invade <hi>Thrace,</hi> thro' <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> with the Forces of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Cavalry of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Hungary. Francis</hi> the 1ſt. promis'd to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark at <hi>Brindi,</hi> with the Croiſacles of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> which amounted to above two hundred thouſand Men, for the making a Deſcent into <hi>Albania,</hi> where the People waited for an occaſion to Revolt. The <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Portugals,</hi> had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to fit out two hundred Galleys, which ſhou'd bear away for <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where the Pope wou'd go in Perſon with a hundred o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Galleys, of which he wou'd be at half-charge
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:53621:250"/>with the State of <hi>Venice.</hi> But a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decine unſeaſonably taken, diſſipated this vaſt Project. The Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> had got a fancy to take a Purge, at his return from Wild-Boar Hunting, and this coſt him his Life; or that his Humours were too much ſtirr'd and fermented, or that he had done too much Exerciſe the day afore. Two Illuſtrious Rivals put in to ſucceed him, namely, <hi>Charles</hi> his Grand-ſon, and <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt. But they went to work in two different manners. <hi>Charles</hi> backt his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions with a good Army, which appear'd in the Low Countrys; and <hi>Francis</hi> reſted ſatisfy'd with buying with ready Money, the Suffrages of the Electors.</p>
            <p>The Pope ſent <hi>Roberto Orſini</hi> to the Diet, to prevent the Election of either of theſe Candidates; and <hi>Orſini,</hi> the moſt dexterous Negotiator of his time, did not remain long at <hi>Francfort,</hi> without penetrating, by his wonderful acuteneſs, into the ſecret of the Affair. He wrote to his Holineſs in a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch, that cannot be ſufficiently Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the <hi>Germans</hi> paulm'd upon <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, by taking the Gold and Silver of <hi>France,</hi> and that not one Elector was there, but wou'd refuſe him his Vote, when the time came to give it; that indeed leſs Repugnance did they harbour in their Minds for Prince
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:53621:250"/>
               <hi>Charles,</hi> but that neither wou'd it go on his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ide, provided there were upon the Rank, a <hi>German</hi> Prince capable of expending at a Rate fitting to uphold the Majeſty of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Upon this Foundation the Pope endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour'd to undeceive <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, and baniſh out of his mind his Pretenſion to the Empire, by ſhewing him the impoſſibility of his attaining it. He diſcover'd to him the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector's Intentions, and added that he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to do, than traverſe, by all manner of means, the Election of <hi>Charles,</hi> becauſe that <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France</hi> might well harbour all manner of Apprehenſions from a Prince, who cou'd employ all the Iron in <hi>Germany,</hi> with the Gold the <hi>Indies</hi> began to and him in abundance. His Holineſs far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerv'd, that the ſureſt means to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, was to Cabal for the Marquis of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> who had already his own Suffrage in Quality of Elector, and held him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf aſſur'd of that of his Brother, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> that the five other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors wou'd declare themſelves infallibly for him, as ſoon as they ſhou'd ſee him backt by <hi>France,</hi> and the Holy See; but that without theſe two Protections they wou'd lift up <hi>Charles</hi> to the Empire.</p>
            <p>The Moſt Chriſtian King did not receive his Office with the ſame ſincerity it was
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:53621:251"/>paid, ſo difficult a thing is it, for a Man to be perſuaded by the ſame Perſons, by whom he thinks he has already been deceiv'd. His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty fancy'd it to be an Artifice us'd to make him renounce his own Glory. His anſwer ſpoke him a Prince, that thought himſelf Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of attaining his Aims; and the Pope ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his obſtinacy, did no longer doubt, but that <hi>Charles</hi> wou'd be choſen, and unwilling by Conſequence, unſeaſonably to incenſe him any longer by Fruitleſly croſs-biting his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, he wrote to <hi>Roberto Orſini,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and favour his Pretences, which he did with ſo good a Grace, that <hi>Charles</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to his Holineſs for his Offices, or at leaſt he ſo himſelf expreſt.</p>
            <p>In the height of this Intrigue, the Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>receiv'd the moſt ſenſible Affliction he was capable of, by loſing young <hi>Lorenzo de Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci,</hi> his Nephew, who dyed of an Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. He left but one Legitimate Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and a Baſtard Son. Thus there only remain'd of the Maſculine Line of <hi>Coſmo</hi> the old, the Pope, and Cardinal <hi>de Medici.</hi> The Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> was not in a Capacity to raiſe up his Houſe again; for beſides his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Prieſt, his Birth lay expos'd to ſo much Cavil, that Eccleſiaſtical Dignities were a much fitter Province for his Circumſtances they being a Sphere which none gain-ſaid
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:53621:251"/>him, than for him to Uſurp a Station in the World, wherein the Popes Legitimation was not ſufficient to maintain him.</p>
            <p>Thus the Pope's Ambition having not a Domeſtick object more to promote, was thenceforward altogether buſy'd in ſignali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing his Pontificate, by acts tranſcending, or it leaſt equalling that of <hi>Giulio</hi> the ſecond<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Predeceſſour. He ſent the Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> to <hi>Florence,</hi> there to ſupply <hi>Loren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce</hi>'s Room, commanded him to govern it with as much gentleneſs, as that young Man had affected harſhneſs. And indeed, <hi>Loren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce</hi> had been dazl'd with his Uricle's Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur. And his Flatterers had made a ſhift to Corrupt him to all Intents. He imagin'd himſelf the greateſt Captain of his time, for that he had a Body proper to ſupport all the fatigues of War; and in this Conceit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of flattering the <hi>Florentines</hi> in their Commerce, he only talkt of Military Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and had nought imported from Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Countries, ſave Arms and Horſes.

               <hi>Rome,</hi> for that their Relations were rather inclin'd they ſhou'd there abide, than in their own Country, where their Reſidence ſtood not with ſo much ſafety, for fear they ſhou'd be whirl'd with the Fancy of raiſing Combuſtions, as had been experienc'd in the Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> who, after having been a while peaceable in that City, yet incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the Death of Duke <hi>Hercules,</hi> his Father, was not contented with Conſpiring againſt his Eldeſt Brother, but had moreover engag'd his two younger in the ſame Plot, ſo as Duke <hi>Alfonſo</hi> eſcap'd not otherwiſe than by Miracle from the Ambuſcades of his three Brothers.</p>
            <p>Among the Cardinals of Soveraign Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, were then reckon'd thoſe of <hi>Naples,</hi> of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> of <hi>Maſſa,</hi> and of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignan.</hi> The number of their Domeſticks was ſix times greater, than that of others. They had all Equipages of Hunting, and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which People went to view out of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, the Hunting matches they made with the Pope, brought into the Field ſuch a multitude of Birds, of Dogs, and Huntſmen, that whole Foreſts and Valleys were ſometimes encompaſs'd with Nets, and depopulated of Game.</p>
            <pb n="423" facs="tcp:53621:254"/>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Bibiana</hi> had moreover introduc'd another Recidation, of no leſs Expence, namely, the repreſentation of Plays, in a ſtately Hall of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> wherein the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corations were chang'd each Act. Their whole buſineſs was to provoke Mirth and Laughter, and no fault did People find with the Subjects being too Libertine. The greateſt Miſchief herein conſiſted, that the Children of the beſt Families, and the Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt, were invited to mount upon the Stage, and ſerve for Actors.</p>
            <p>The Pope had another Infirmity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ſhall alledge two Examples, ſince it is difficult to find, in Hiſtory, another Perſon ſubject to the like. As he was of a Facetious Humour, and lov'd to let nothing ſcape, without turning it to his Diverſion, as ſoon as he perceiv'd a Man prepoſſeſs'd with a good Opinion of himſelf, he applauded him in all occaſions, and made it his buſineſs to flatter him, till ſuch time as he caus'd this Principle of Vanity, to degenerate into Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance. That Secretary of his, the ableſt man alive for Chancery Expeditions, was call'd <hi>Evangeliſt Taraſconi:</hi> This Perſon had the weakneſs to neglect what he knew to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and pretended to Sciences he did not underſtand. As he cou'd not be ignorant that the Pope delighted more in Muſick, than
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:53621:255"/>in other Arts, as being therein moſt skill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and refin'd, he apply'd his mind to't, without other deſign at firſt, than the being capable to talk regularly of Simphony. But as his Talent lay not this way, he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtook the Bent and Senſe of the things ſhew'd him by his Maſters. The Pope quickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it, and was not wanting to perſuade him, that he made an admirable Progreſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of minding him, that a Man ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſtudy in ſpight of <hi>Minerva.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Taraſconi</hi> believ'd the Pope ſpoke Truth, and ſo addicted his Thoughts to Muſick, that it crackt his Brain. I ſhall not relate in this place the particulars of his Follies; I will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that they never tyr'd the Patience of him that occaſion'd them; for the Pope ſuffer'd him publickly to maintain, that no Man, afore him, underſtood Muſick, and let him alter all the Rules of that Art. Nay, his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs proceeded ſtill farther; for he made him the Arbiter of all the Symphony of his Houſe, and promis'd him, on a day of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, to cauſe the Muſicians Arms to be bound, under Colour, that their Nerves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſt ty'd, they wou'd touch the Strings with more ſteddineſs and delicacy. At laſt, the Pope conſented to the taking down the Tapiſtry of the Hall, where he din'd, upon a requeſt preſented him by <hi>Taraſconi,</hi> groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:53621:255"/>upon this, that the Voices of the Muſicians, and the ſound of the Inſtruments coming to ſtrike the Silk and Woolen of the Tapiſtry, loſt thereby their Force, and ſoft'ned by the ſame Reaſon that the Canon produc'd ſo little effect upon the like Materials, whereas if thoſe Voices, and that ſound broke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves directly upon the Walls and Marble of the Hall, the Reflection wou'd be more entire and neat, and wou'd return more ſhrill to the Ears, and with a more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſound.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Taraſconi, Baraballi de Gayeto</hi> ſerv'd for a May-game to the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> A Man, he was of a good Family, and well made of his Perſon, thought himſelf the beſt <hi>Italian</hi> Poet of his time, tho' a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to make more wretched Verſes than thoſe of his, which nevertheleſs he rehears'd gracefully enough. As ſoon as the Pope had heard him in his way, he perceiv'd his Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit, and perſuaded him; that never in this World, was there ſuch ſtately Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as his Verſes. <hi>Baraballi,</hi> at firſt, fancy'd his Holineſſes Diſcourſe to be the effect of his Goodneſs; but the Pope ſtrain'd ſo long to give immoderate Praiſes to this poor Poet, every time he came to recite new Pieces to him, that he quite unhing'd his
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:53621:256"/>Brain. He put it in his Head, that he was another <hi>Petrarch,</hi> and whirl'd him with a deſire to Triumph, as that Poet had done in <hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope took upon him to be at all the Charge of the Solemnity, and ſent throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> to invite the Tribe of <hi>Parnaſſus.</hi> All the Ceremonies that are to uſher in an Action of this Importance, were ſeriouſly obſerv'd; and the Pope, to render it the more ridiculous, wou'd needs have <hi>Baraballi</hi> to be mounted upon an Elephant, a preſent newly made his Holineſs by the King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> The Day was appointed, and all the Learned Men in <hi>Italy</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to honour, with their Preſences, a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony that had not been practis'd for three hundred years paſt, under pretence of paying them the Expences of their Journeys, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon their Arrival, and that they ſhou'd have a ſufficient Allowance for their return home, after having been treated Magnificently, during their ſtay.</p>
            <p>The News of this being brought to <hi>Gaieto,</hi> created Fear and Vexation. <hi>Baraballi</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations haſten'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> to divert him from a Project, which over-whelm'd both them, and their Poſterity, with Shame and Scandal; but they could not in the leaſt prevail o're ſo prepoſſeſs'd a Soul, on the contrary, he tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them as Enviers of his Glory, and as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:53621:256"/>that had not a due Opinion of the Popes Juſtice and Sincerity, ſince they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd his Holineſs deſign'd to impoſe upon the World. Thus the day being come ('twas the Feaſt of <hi>San Coſmo,</hi> and <hi>San Damiano,</hi> which the Houſe of <hi>Medici</hi> own'd as their Protector) the Poets, fantaſtically Garbed, went to take up <hi>Baraballi</hi> at his own Houſe, and Conducted him to the Feaſt prepared for him at the Popes.</p>
            <p>The Spectacle afforded ſo much the more pleaſure, in that it was hard to find, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Europe,</hi> an Old Man of a better Mien than the Triumpher. He was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily tall, and proportionably big, had a freſh ruddy Countenance, and a venerable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eard. He had on the Triumphal Robe, and was array'd in all the Trappings, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with all the pomp, wherewith the Ancients had flatter'd the Vanity of their Heroes. The Pope, who had an admirable lucky knack in all ſorts of Ceremonies, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly delighted in having this perform'd with the utmoſt exactneſs. <hi>Baraballi</hi> recited, with a Tone wherein he was obſerv'd to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud himſelf the Eſſay he had Compos'd, to ſtand as his Maſter-piece. All the other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets pretended to admire it, and proteſted, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing comparable cou'd iſſue from their Veins. The Judges, upon their avowal, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:53621:257"/>the Triumph, and <hi>Baraballi</hi> deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the Court of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> while the Pope ſtood at a Window to ſee him mount the Elephant.</p>
            <p>This Animal was very docible, and ſhew'd ſome ſort of Complaiſance for his Gold Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broider'd Saddle, and Purple Houſe, which he was not wont to wear, he gently ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd <hi>Baraballi</hi> to get on his back, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be led along tow'rds the Capitol; but when he came to paſs o're the Bridge, he fell into ſuch a Fury, and caus'd the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpher to make ſo great a Leap, that had not the Rails ſav'd him, the Triumpher had fall'n into the River; then ſcour'd the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant back, and topſey-turvey'd all in his way, from the Bridge to the <hi>Vatican,</hi> that is to ſay, the whole Troop of Poets. What render'd the Scene ſtill the more diverting was; that the Elephant return'd into the Pope's Court with the ſame Docility, and without appearing any more mov'd, than if he had thrown no body down. He was thought to have been firſt ſtartl'd into that wildneſs, by the ſight of ſo many People, or by being ſurpriz'd with the confus'd ſound of ſo many Voices and Inſtruments, eccho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on all ſides.</p>
            <p>The Paſſion the Pope ſhew'd for good Cheer, made him love the Converſation of
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:53621:257"/>four the moſt famous and agreeable Paraſites, at that time in <hi>Italy,</hi> namely, the youngeſt of <hi>Poggio</hi>'s Children, <hi>Sacramore,</hi> the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier <hi>Brandini,</hi> and <hi>Moine Bouſoni Mariani.</hi> They invented Sawces for a new fort of Kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw, only ſtuff'd with what was moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in the Fleſh of Pheaſants, and coſt ſo dear, that the Pope's Succeſſour, cou'd not forbear having him in Execration, when he examin'd the Expence of his Table. The Paraſites were there receiv'd at certain days, and treated in the manner they deſir'd, on Condition they wou'd endure, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Pet, all the little Malices, that were put upon them by the Officers in the Kitchin, who made it their whole Contrivance, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on their Taſte and Guſto, and caus'd them to eat the Fleſh of Crows and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys, under the Cover of ſome other Meats.</p>
            <p>The Pope was likewiſe careful to invite the Cardinals on the firſt day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and with them while away the After-noon, in playing at Cards; but all the Money Gam'd for, and all the Winnings were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed to the Poor; but he had an averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Dice, yet plaid ſo perfectly well at Cheſs, that none ever beat him at it. He abſtain'd from Meat on <hi>Wedneſdays,</hi> and eat only Herbs on <hi>Frydays,</hi> and never ſupp'd on
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:53621:258"/>
               <hi>Saturdays.</hi> I have but one Circumſtance to relate upon the abuſe of his Indulgences, that has ſcap'd <hi>Padre Paulo,</hi> namely, that they ſhew'd, in <hi>Germany,</hi> a Bull, which ſet a Crown Tax for admittance into Paradiſe.</p>
            <p>He neglected the Fabrick of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> so finiſh the Gallery of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> Painted by <hi>Rofaele d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> that incomparable Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that brought Painting to a point of Perfection, unknown ſince <hi>Apelles.</hi> He dy'd when thirty ſix years old, by the Popes and his own fault. He had a promiſe to be made Cardinal, and no doubt had been ſo at the firſt Promotion. The Pope delighted in Diſcourſing him, and almoſt daily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd his Work. He ſaw him once extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily heated, and, feeling his Pulſe, found that he had a Feaver.

<pb n="431" facs="tcp:53621:258"/>wrought and accompliſht upon Silk and Woolen, that the Pope had reaſon to be therewith ſatisfy'd, tho' the ſuit of Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings coſt him ſev'nty thouſand Crowns.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs I muſt note in this place, that Symony was neither ſo great nor ſo publick under the Popedom of <hi>Leo,</hi> as it had been under thoſe of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Julius:</hi> For tho' the great Penitentiary was prepoſſeſs'd with two Maximes, which ſeem'd to Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Venality of Benefices, tho' he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that the Pope purg'd all ſorts of Symo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and cou'd not commit any: I have found nevertheleſs in Authentick Memoirs, that <hi>Leo</hi> did pretty often take the pains to examine the Expeditions, which this Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary preſented him to Sign, and twing'd him, ſometimes with ſevere Corrections, yet without threatning to turn him out of his Place, as being in truth the ſhrewdeſt Man in <hi>Italy</hi> for the Canon-Law.</p>
            <p>I have likewiſe found in the ſame place, that <hi>Giulio Blanci,</hi> his Favourite, nick'd his time, to make him ſign a Requeſt, when his Holineſs was ſo in haſte, that he had not the leiſure to peruſe it. But <hi>Blenci</hi> being not wont to concern himſelf in ſuch like matters, the Pope ſuſpected ſome trick, and leaving what he had to do, read the Requeſt quite o're; he found he was petition'd to unite
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:53621:259"/>two Benefices ſcituated in two Provinces remote from one another; and the Motive of him who ſollicited the Union, was to raze a Church, that ſtood too near his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, which none wou'd have oppos'd, if the Priory of that Church, with which his Son was endow'd, had been join'd to another Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory, which the ſame Son held in another Province. But the Pope did not trouble himſelf with inquiring into the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he only ask'd <hi>Blanci,</hi> how much he had been promis'd to get the paſſing of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and <hi>Blanci,</hi> thinking he ſtood well enough in his Maſters mind, to own the truth to him, with impunity, made anſwer, he ſhou'd get two hundred Crowns. He had no ſooner bolted theſe words, but the Pope ran to a Trunck, wherein he had Money, took out two hundred Crowns, gave them to <hi>Blanci,</hi> and tore the Requeſt.</p>
            <p>In this manner did the Pope handle parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Affairs, while Fortune was labouring to embroil him with <hi>France.</hi> He had not had any tye with the Moſt Chriſtian King, ſince young <hi>Lorenzo de Medici</hi>'s Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance had proſper'd ſo ill. On the contrary, he complain'd loud enough, that, at <hi>Paris,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Miniſtry had ſpirited from him Cardinal <hi>Bibiana,</hi> as to take away all ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Doubt, but that he was contriving
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:53621:259"/>to be reveng'd, tho' the manner of that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals dying after his return, at his coming from an entertainment, at which the Pope had preſented him a Bit, which he durſt not refuſe, had not Convinc'd the moſt Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous. Beſides, he cou'd hardly diſgeſt that the <hi>French</hi> Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> wou'd neither ſuffer the Benefices of that Dutchy to be enjoy'd by others, than thoſe that eſpous'd the Intereſts of <hi>France,</hi> nor allow who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſputed them, to go plead at <hi>Rome,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, afore the Holy See was in Poſſeſſion, of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating with full Right, and of judging Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignly the Proceſſes which aroſe in that matter.</p>
            <p>The Emperour had then, at <hi>Rome;</hi> an Ambaſſadour, <hi>John Manuel</hi> by Name who ſerv'd him with ſo much the more Zeal, in that he had been more a Favourite of <hi>Philip</hi> the Firſt, his Father, than any other <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> and had ſuffer'd Perſecutions from King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> after the death of that young Prince. This Miniſter had all the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities requiſite for Negotiation, and had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated himſelf into the Pope's Affection, by giving him overtures, which nevertheleſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="434" facs="tcp:53621:260"/>to him, in his Maſter's Name, the Plan of a League, that cou'd not be better contriv'd; for the Emperour was to be at all the Charges, and run all the riſque, without reaping any apparent advantage. He took upon him to raiſe and maintain the Armies: He left to the Pope the liberty of naming their General; he conſented they ſhou'd receive from his Holineſs, the moſt material Orders, upon what they ſhou'd undertake, in ſhort expos'd himſelf to the loſing the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> in caſe they came by the worſt. Nevertheleſs he renounc'd the Fruits, which the League might thereby reap, if Fortune favour'd his Arms; and making before hand but two Lots of the Spoil and Booty of the <hi>French,</hi> he gave one of them, namely, the States of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Plaſanza,</hi> to the Holy See; and th' other, containing the reſt of <hi>Milan,</hi> was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to the <hi>Sforza</hi>'s, without the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's exacting ought elſe, than a new Oath, from him that ſhou'd be therewith inveſted.</p>
            <p>The Deſign was too well laid, for the Pope to reſiſt the temptation of eſpouſing it. He ſign'd the Articles, that were preſented him, without making the leaſt Alteration; and as there's no being without Money, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a War, he created four hundred Offices of Knights, which were ſold at a
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:53621:260"/>thouſand Crowns a-piece, by aſſigning them a hundred Crowns Revenue, upon good Funds. He pitcht his Eyes upon <hi>Proſpero Colonna</hi> for the Generalſhip, as ſuppoſing the Marquis <hi>de Peſcairo,</hi> Commanding the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Infantry, wou'd cotton well enough with him, after having Marry'd his Niece. But miſtaken was he in his Conjecture, and the Army of the League had no ſooner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to act, but that <hi>Proſpero</hi> and <hi>Peſcairo</hi> fell out, and claſht more than if there had been no Alliance between them.</p>
            <p>Their Diſcord occaſion'd the raiſing of the Siege of <hi>Parma,</hi> and plung'd their Troops into an irreſolution, which wou'd not have fail'd of ruining them, if the Pope had not devis'd an Expedient, that fitted his purpoſe. Tho' he knew how neceſſary the Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi>'s Preſence was at <hi>Florence,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the People in due Bounds: Yet he wrote to him to leave that Place, and go with all expedition to the Army, in quality of Legate, in order to reconcile the two principal Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and put them again upon Action: The Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> obey'd, tho' he deſpair'd of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="436" facs="tcp:53621:261"/>hardly more than the bare name of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and this <hi>Peſcairo</hi> accepted, as finding it for his turn. Then the Cardinal induc'd them both to drive on the War into the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of <hi>Milan.</hi> This they conſented to; and <hi>Lautrec</hi> having not been able to hinder them the paſſage of <hi>Loglio,</hi> as being abandon'd by the <hi>Suizzers,</hi> in default of payment, they were Maſters of the Field, and preſented themſelves before the Gates of the principal Cities, wherein they were receiv'd by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the <hi>Ghibelline</hi> Faction. Thoſe of <hi>Milan</hi> were likewiſe open'd to them by the <hi>Pallivici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi>'s, in revenge for that <hi>Lautrec</hi> had put two Cavaliers of their Family to Death, without obſerving all the forms of Law; and the <hi>French</hi> were driven out of <hi>Lombardy</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, with as much eaſe as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p>The Pope receiv'd the news of this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, when a Hunting, and had at the ſame time a tumultuous Joy, that caſt him into a Fever. He was wont to ſwallow, at his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Supper, Aloes Pills, which kept his Body open; and <hi>Serapita,</hi> his <hi>Valet de Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre,</hi> whoſe buſineſs it was to preſent them to him, kept them ſo negligently in a Box, as render'd it eaſie to come at them, and take of them who wou'd: Two days afore the Pope fell ill, <hi>Lesbi,</hi> the Butler, was mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:53621:261"/>to ſteal out a Couple, and ſwallow them, but was found dead the next morning in his Bed, tho' to ſleep he went in perfect Health. The Pope took them at his uſual hour, and perceiving they caus'd in him a thirſty alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, call'd for Drink of <hi>Barnaby Maleſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who ſerv'd him with ſo bitter a Wine, that the Pope, who never complain'd of it at other times, cou'd not refrain from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Faces, while a drinking; and telling <hi>Maleſpina, I fancy thou haſt laid a Wager to make me drink Purle. Maleſpina</hi> made no Anſwer, and was contented with pouring out what Wine remain'd in the Bottle, and with fetching another.</p>
            <p>The Pope ſupp'd with a good Appetite, and was neither ill that Evening, nor the Night enſuing; but on the morrow after, having read the Diſpatch Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> wrote him from <hi>Milan,</hi> he was ſeen in too violent Impetuoſities of Joy, for People to miſs obſerving, that too much foreign heat was kindl'd in his Temperament. Yet not much minded at firſt, becauſe they did not think there cou'd be exceſs in rejoycing at the Diſgrace of the <hi>French.</hi> But the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, which the Pope complain'd of after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, caus'd ſome reflection to be made, tho' it ſtartled them not ſo much, as the ſhuddering he underwent, when he askt
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:53621:262"/>for Drink. The Phyſicians, who obſerv'd this ſhivering, made no account of it; for beſides its being neither great, nor of long continuance, it ended in ſo fine a breathing Sweat, that they poſitively declar'd, it wou'd coſt his Holineſs but that fit. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they had him carry'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> but ſome Miles diſtant; and the Malady aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting ſtill on the way; the firſt object that offer'd it ſelf to the Pope, at his entrance into the <hi>Vatican,</hi> was an ill Omen; 'twas a Sculptor, who came to ſhew him the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of a <hi>Mauſoleum,</hi> the King of <hi>England</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Erect for his Anceſtors, of the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> whoſe Bones were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd up throughout all the Countreys in <hi>Europe,</hi> where they dy'd in Exile. As the Pope underſtood Sculpture admirably well, he was very curious that way, and caus'd <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> to work on his own Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which redoubl'd his Curioſity for ſuch like works: And indeed he fail'd not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine that of <hi>England,</hi> and ſpeak his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. As ſoon as in Bed, the Fever ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh'd, that the Phyſicians believ'd him Cur'd. He ſpent two hours in receiving the Congratulations of the Cardinals, upon the Proſperity of his Arms, and felt not any pain, during that Interval. But all of a ſudden the Fever return'd, nay, and at the
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:53621:262"/>very firſt, with that violence, that it got into his Brain. Then did they judge the Diſtemper to be extream; all forts of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were us'd to bring the Patient back into his right Senſes; this they effected, and he recover'd his Reaſon, after ſix hours agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein they had obſerv'd all the ſymptoms of approaching Death. He o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd his Eyes, and ſpoke, but no more than only to recommend his Soul to God, and to affirm he dy'd content, after having reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Plaiſanza,</hi> without ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Blood. Immediately he fell again into his Frenzy, and expir'd at one a Clock at Night, on the third of <hi>December,</hi> Fifteen hundred twenty one, being not yet full for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſev'n years old.</p>
            <p>Never was Pope ſo lamented, by his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, bating <hi>Maleſpina,</hi> who, at break of day, came to the Palace Gate, with an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of Hunting, and askt to be let out. The <hi>Suizzars,</hi> on the Guard, being fir'd with Indignation, to ſee a Man purſuing his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, in the midſt of the publick Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſtopp'd him; and thoſe who remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred what the Pope had ſaid of the Glaſs of Wine he had giv'n him, thought themſelves in duty bound to ſecure his Perſon, and clap Guards upon him. He was the more narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watcht, after that the Body being open'd,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:53621:263"/>in it were found two infallible marks of Poyſon; one, that the Heart was markt all o're with Black and Livid Spots, and th' o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Spleen was ſo ſtraitn'd and rivell'd up, that much ado they had to find it. The Cardinal <hi>de Medici</hi> had an account giv'n him of all theſe Particularities; and at his Arrival, all the late Popes Servants threw themſelves at his Feer, and Conjur'd him to put <hi>Maleſpina</hi> to the Rack. But he wav'd doing it, upon his being preſs'd to enter the Conclave. Yet this was not what hindred him; and thoſe who knew to the very bottom of his Soul, judg'd he forbore to examine into the Pope's Death, out of a refinement of Prudence, which made him fear finding, among the Culpable, Perſons ſo qualify'd, as were able to break all the Meaſures he had taken to mount, in his turn, on the Throne of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Thus <hi>Maleſpina</hi> was releas'd, without having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd ought elſe than Impriſonment. He wander'd a long time in <hi>Italy,</hi> and at length ſetl'd himſelf in the City of <hi>Milan,</hi> where nine years after Pope <hi>Leo</hi>'s Death, he was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to be Beheaded for an Aſſaſſination. He own'd nothing, at his Execution, of what related to the poyſoning the Pope, and his ſilence has giv'n Hiſtorians occaſion to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, nothing extraordinary to have been
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:53621:263"/>in that matter; and that the Wound remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Ulcer, of which I have already ſpoken, coming to cloſe, and the ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which Nature eas'd it ſelf of that way from time to time, being barr'd vent and iſſue, had thrown themſelves upon the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Parts: They added to back their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that the South-wind blowing at that time, had rais'd from the Marſhes, near the place where the Pope Hunted, a Peſtilential Exhalation, that had more influence upon his Holineſs, than on thoſe of his Retinue, becauſe that being more heated, the Pores of his Body were more open to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Air. But eaſie it is to anſwer to the firſt of thoſe Arguments, that the Wound had been but too lately clos'd, to maintain that the ill humours could have had leiſure to Corrupt the Heart and the Spleen to that degree they were found to be at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Body, beſides that prodigious Thirſt might be attributed to the Pills, which when poyſon'd is unknown. It is as eaſie to anſwer to the ſecond, in ſaying, that it is to divine and form a Chimerical Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as to conceive one, of which the Popes Body only to be ſuſceptible; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his being not the moſt fervent of the Company in the Purſuit, and that common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he did not over-heat himſelf; his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:53621:264"/>was the moſt robuſt, and capable of reſiſting the Injuries of the Air, of all thoſe of the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> For neither was there a bigger, nor a more vigorous Man in his Court, and his Humours were in ſo juſt a proportion, that they cou'd not have been diſorder'd, till after a hundred years Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, if there had not been ſome Poyſon in the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Be it as it will, never Pope dy'd of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, to which he had leſs Diſpoſition. He was neither lean nor dry, and his Brain was too groſs to be offuſcated at firſt, by the bare Vapours of a ſlight Feaver. The much Exerciſe he us'd, ſhou'd exempt him from an unforeſeen Oppreſſion. He had nothing weak, beſides his Eyes, and indeed they were very large, yet was he able to ſee to the ſmalleſt things, and read a long while, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being incommoded. Moreover he had got a ſort of Spectacles, which he ever carry'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and principally a Hunting; they made him diſtinguiſh Birds and Beaſts at a much greater diſtance, than other Perſons cou'd do, and afforded him ſometimes the pleaſure of ſhooting and killing them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perceiv'd by others. Their Matter was of Chryſtal, and their Figure Coneave. I have not met with the Workmans name, nor of him who preſented them to the Pope;
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:53621:264"/>but certain it is, that his Holineſs had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo precious, and were not broken in the moſt violent Exerciſes.</p>
            <p>He had a nice and pregnant Wit; and notwithſtanding he had choſen for his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries, the two moſt Eloquent Men of that Age; yet was he capable of turning a Letter as well as they, when ſo minded witneſs that he wrote to Cardinal <hi>de Medici,</hi> upon ſending him to <hi>Milan,</hi> in quality of Legate; and the agreeable Billets he direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Eldeſt Siſter, Marry'd into the Houſe of <hi>Cibo.</hi> He likewiſe compos'd eaſie and elegant Latin Verſes, but did not ſo much delight in them, as in th' <hi>Italian;</hi> and as no man underſtood better than he, the fineſt Delicacy of the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Tongue, ſo no Man made more Elegant Sonnets, nor Elegies better contriv'd. He had taken the pains to read all the Celebrated Hiſtorians, and tho' he was too quick and haſty to have the patience to make extracts out of them; yet he had them ſo well imprinted in his mind, that he never fail'd of Citing their fineſt Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, when th' occaſion ſo requir'd. He was ſo early accuſtom'd to judge of others Works, that his Criticiſme was commonly infallible; and in the debates which aroſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the topping Wits, they appeal'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the Judgment of the Academy to
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:53621:265"/>his Holineſſes. He officiated the Solemn Feaſts with ſo much Grace and Majeſty, that Spectators flocked thither from all Parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> The Moſt Chriſtian King. <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, after having ſeen him ſay Maſs at <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna,</hi> did affirm never to have been better Convinc'd of the importance of thoſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, for the lifting up the mind to God. As the Virtue he moſt valu'd himſelf upon, was Liberality, he exercis'd it with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, wholly peculiar to him. He had ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy'd to the very Geſtures, and to the tone of the Voice, which were to be practis'd in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that he might the better win the Heart of him, who receiv'd any thing from him; and never was there obſerv'd more Joy in a Face, than appear'd on his, when it chanc'd him to be able to prevent the Requeſts that People had to make him. He affected ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when conſtrain'd to refuſe them; but this ſadneſs was accompany'd with ſo tender an Aer, that People took his denial in no ill part. Ten Perſons of Quality were once ſeen to demand of him the Arch-biſhoprick of <hi>Ravenna;</hi> he had the ſame Civility for 'em all, diſcours'd 'em apart, pry'd, by their Diſcourſe, into the ſecret of their Intereſts, and gave the Benefice to him he had a mind to gratify, without diſcontenting th' other Nine, becauſe he gave or promis'd them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:53621:265"/>that ſeem'd fitter for their turns. When he gave, he ſtill made his Excuſes, for his not having opportunity of giving more; and the bluſhing, which never fail'd mounting into his Face, made it believ'd he ſpoke ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, and gave ſuch vaſt I dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of his Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, that all the Revenues of the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, wou'd not have been capable of ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, if he had giv'en all from him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
            <p>He ſaid his Father had enjoin'd him three Rules for his Conduct, at his ſending him to <hi>Rome.</hi> The firſt, to uſe as much care to keep himſelf in his Friends Eſteem, as he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to acquire their Amity. The ſecond, to repair, by continual Offices, the Decay, which abſence made in the ſtricteſt Engagements. And the third, to live without Diſtruſt, in what regarded his own Perſon, but to be ever diffident for the State, of which he made a part. In fine, he had, during his Life, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Death, the two kinds of Happineſſes, which moſt ſignalize the Governments of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns. I mean that <hi>Rome</hi> was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily flouriſhing, during his Papacy, and ſo miſerable, under the two following, that the Compariſon of them cou'd not be made without regretting him, more than ever any Man had been.

            <p>AS no man underſtood better than <hi>Leo,</hi> to gain the Love of the topping Wits, by doing them good, no man had ever had ſo great a number of them in his Retinue, and Intereſts. <hi>Pomponius. Latus</hi> was the Brat of a Country Laſs, whom the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> had abus'd, under the whea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:53621:267"/>of Marriage. He was brought up to War, and 'twas the ruin of the Houſe of <hi>San Severino,</hi> of which his Father was the Eldeſt, that made him deſiſt from that Profeſſion. He was of the number of thoſe Learned Men, who chang'd their Names, upon taking their Degrees in the Univerſity of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was ſubject to the Perſecution that <hi>Platina</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limachus</hi> endur'd on that account, when <hi>Paul</hi> the 2d, inſtead of laughing at this Whim, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd it a Cover to a Conſpiracy, brooded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Life. Afterwards his Auditory was ſo fill'd, that a Man was forc'd to go thither by Midnight to get room. He went from his Lodging before Day, and carry'd himſelf his Lanthorn. A hard matter was it to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him, when he ſpoke Familiarly, but he never ſtutter'd in his Explications. He Cook'd all his Meat himſelf, and the moſt Illuſtrious of his Scholars ſometimes gave him a helping hand, in the Kitchin, for to eaſe him, when they had a mind to make advantage of the time he wou'd have ſpent in that Office. He has left a Grammar, and the Hiſtory of the Emperours, and of the Ruins of Old <hi>Rome.</hi> He dy'd at ſev'nty years of age, by having drunk Wine with Ice.</p>

               <hi>Callimachus,</hi> after having been put to the Rack, and tormented more than the other Virtuoſi's, becauſe he had aſſum'd a <hi>Greek</hi>
               <pb n="449" facs="tcp:53621:267"/>Name, which the Pope did not at all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, made his eſcape into <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country, from whence <hi>Caſimir</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> call'd him to be the Tutor of his Eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Son, reigning ſince by the Name of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert.</hi> He was this young Prince's Favourite, but the Counſel he gave him, to rid his hands of the principal Lords of <hi>Poland,</hi> by placing them at the Head of the Army, when a going to Fight the <hi>Moldavians,</hi> wrought his Diſgrace, and rais'd him ſo many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as put the King under the Conſtraint of abandoning him. He found however at <hi>Vilna,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> a Friend, who hid him in his Houſe, fed him, without making any body privy, no not ſo much as his own Wife, aſſiſted him till Death, caus'd his Body to be dry'd in an Ov'n, put it into a Cup-board, and kept it till the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Nobility being cool'd, he had an honourable Burial made him at <hi>Cracow,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Bones were transferr'd. We have nothing left of his, ſave the Life of <hi>Ladiſlaus,</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who dy'd in the Battel of <hi>Varnez,</hi> but 'tis ſo fine a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, that whoſoever ſhall take the pains to read it, will judge, without my giving him the hint, that there never was a better ſince that of <hi>Tacitus.</hi>

               <hi>Geronimo Savonarola,</hi> a Religious of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> rubb'd out in a prodigious Auſterity of Life at <hi>Florence,</hi> and made appear what Eloquence can do, when backt with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of Sanctity. He had the gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and this is, perchance, the reaſon, that tho' he had a great eſteem for <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> and for his Children, he wou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have any other engagements with them, than thoſe of Study, as conſidering them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready as Perſons that were to ſubject their Country. He govern'd his Republick for the ſpace of four years, and was the ſole Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Negotiate at <hi>Piſa</hi> with <hi>Charles</hi> the 8th, whoſe coming he had long afore prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. He declar'd publickly, that he wou'd be at <hi>Naples,</hi> and maintain his footing there, provided he caus'd his Troops to obſerve an exact Diſcipline; but that at all adventures he wou'd tread the <hi>Italians</hi> under Foot, at his return. It's ſomewhat a difficult buſineſs to ſay, what occaſion'd the downfall of this new Prophet. Two things did thereto very much Contribute; one, the Reformation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which he aim'd at, introducing into <hi>Florence;</hi> and th' other, the Example he gave, for People to declaim Publickly againſt the Vices of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 6th. Arm'd there were againſt him, the Relations of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Gentlemen, whom he had caus'd to be
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:53621:268"/>put to Death; for having Conſpir'd againſt the Government. They ſet Fire to the Convent Door, hall'd away thoſe who ran in to his Defence, took him and Condemn'd him to the Flames, which he ſuffer'd in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing and begining the Pſalms of Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. The beſt of his Works are, <hi>The Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of the Croſs,</hi> and <hi>The Simplicity of a Chriſtian Life.</hi>

               <hi>Marcileo Ficino</hi> was ſuch a little dapper Fellow, that he reach'd not to the Girdle of a Man of an ordinary Stature, but ſo well proportion'd, ſo neat, and of ſo gay an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that none were ever weary of his Company. He was ſo poſſeſs'd with the care of his Health, that he often ſhifted his black Cap, nay, ſix or ſev'n times in an hour. He had caus'd Cloaths and Coverlets to be made him for all the Winds that blow'd, and for all the irregularities of the Seaſons. The Houſe of <hi>Medici</hi> procur'd him a Prebendary, a Houſe in the Town, and another in the Countrey, and gave him likewiſe a Penſion, for Tranſlating into <hi>Latin</hi> the Works of <hi>Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi> of <hi>Jamblicus,</hi> of <hi>Pſelle,</hi> and of <hi>Cineſias.</hi> He wrote with all the eaſineſs imaginable. Yet what he did was ſo finiſht, that none durſt venture to touch again and Poliſh it. He dy'd almoſt without pain at ſev'nty years of Age, on the ſame Day that the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi>
               <pb n="452" facs="tcp:53621:269"/>caus'd <hi>Paulo Vitelli,</hi> their General, to be Beheaded, leſt he might take revenge for their having unjuſtly ſuſpected him of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy.</p>

               <hi>Galeas Martius</hi> ſerv'd King <hi>Mathias</hi> of <hi>Hungary,</hi> at the ſame time, as Tutor for Sciences, Secretary for Diſpatches, a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in War, and Champion in Turnaments. He compos'd two Books, under a malign Conſtellation; the firſt, treating of Man, had the misfortune to be ſo roughly handl'd by <hi>Merula</hi> the Critick, that its Author, of his own proper Election, ſet about ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing it; and the ſecond, treating of the Virtue of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> made him incur the Perſecution of the Religious, who caus'd him to be clapt up into Priſon, whence he had been doom'd to the Flames, if Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 4th, who had been his Pupil, had not interpos'd all his Authority, to retrieve him out of their Clutches, and after all, was he forc'd to undergo a publick Pennance. He liv'd near fourſcore years, and became ſo big and bulky, that not a Horſe was there could carry him. He dy'd of a Rupture.</p>

               <hi>Eliſius Calentius</hi> was a Poet famous at the Court of <hi>Naples,</hi> receiving, from King <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo,</hi> the ſame Penſion that <hi>Pontan, Artili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Gravina,</hi> and <hi>Seneſar,</hi> whoſe buſineſs was to judge of pieces preſented to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,

As he had ſet <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullus</hi> for his Pattern, ſo was he of as amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a Complexion as that <hi>Roman,</hi> and made Elegies infinitely paſſionate, tho' they were not all of equal force. He tranſlated into <hi>Latin</hi> Verſe, <hi>Homer</hi>'s War of the Rats a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Frogs, and being become old, with a Charge of Children, he repented his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpared nothing, during his Youth, and teſtify'd it by this Epitaph.

               <hi>Pandolfo Callenucio</hi> was a Lawyer by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but ſo inconſtant in his Study, that hardly had he the firſt Elements of a Science, than that he fell to another. However, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well made and Eloquent, and having beſides the Qualities neceſſary for Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was employ'd in ſeveral Embaſſies. He compos'd the Apology for <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hiſtory; a Treatiſe of the Viper, and a Dialogue compleatly Boufon, Waggiſh, and Badeen, between the Head and the Cap; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he wrote the Lives of the Kings of <hi>Naples,</hi> in the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Tongue, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Duke <hi>Hercules</hi> of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> who
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:53621:270"/>underſtood not <hi>Latin.</hi> He dy'd at <hi>Peſaro,</hi> where <hi>Giovanni Sforza</hi> had got him by Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and caus'd him there to be ſtrangl'd, in revenge, for having intercepted one of his Letters.</p>

Antonio da Palermo,</hi> Secreatary of State, found him in the Street, and in his Phyſiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy obſerving I know not what extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, took care of his Education. He inſtructed him ſo well, that he became the moſt Celebrated of the Poets, and Orators of his time. He wou'd needs alſo undertake to write Hiſtory, but with ſo little ſucceſs, that he accus'd himſelf, that all his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of that kind, had only diſcover'd his Weakneſs. He ſucceeded his Benefactor in his place. He marry'd a Wife, who brought him a vaſt Fortune, but, tow'rds the end of his Life, he decay'd in his Reputation, by means of his Panegyrick on <hi>Charles</hi> the 8th, and his Dialogue, Intitul'd <hi>Charon,</hi> the firſt of thoſe two pieces being ſo ſtuff'd with flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and with Detraction the ſecond. He dy'd when ſev'nty ſev'n years old, after having caus'd a magnificent Tomb to be
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:53621:270"/>Erected for his Bones; but forgot to put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Will, which Epitaph he deſign'd to be thereon engrav'd, of the four he had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd.</p>

               <hi>Marcus Antonius Coctius Sabellicus</hi> was the Son of a Black-Smith, and fell to keeping School at <hi>Tivoli,</hi> where he gain'd ſufficient to live on at <hi>Rome,</hi> for ſeveral years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Pomponius Latus</hi> introduc'd him into the Academy, which fil'd off his Ruſt, and made him capable of being call'd by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of <hi>Venice,</hi> to write the Hiſtory of the Republick, and to give Leſſons to the young Gentlemen, for an allowance of three hundred Crowns. He acquitted himſelf bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſecond of theſe Provinces, than of the firſt; for the flattery is ſo courſe and fulſome in his Hiſtory, that it's perceiv'd by the leaſt refin'd. But the moſt fantaſtick part in his Conduct was, that after having blunder'd in his particular Hiſtory, he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd he ſhou'd perform better in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. He began that of the World from <hi>Adam,</hi> and made thoſe great Volumes of <hi>Enneades,</hi> which People are far from reading, when once they are inform'd, that the moſt curious Matters almoſt all are paſs'd o're in ſilence, and the moſt common handl'd with a tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Accuracy. When ſev'nty years old, he dy'd of a ſcandalous Diſeaſe, the ſecret
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:53621:271"/>of Curing which being not then known. He left but one Baſtard, to whom he wou'd not commit the care of his Burial, he lov'd rather to contrive it himſelf, and writ this Epitaph, in which I ſhou'd find no Fault, had another made it.</p>

The Man who ſold it, caus'd to be inferted in the Contract, that in caſe <hi>Laurentianus</hi> did not furniſh the whole Sum in ſix Months ſpace, he might enter upon his Houſe again, without being bound to repay what he had receiv'd, and <hi>Laurentianus</hi> conſented thereto, as making account to have, by that time, wherewithall to clear the Bargain. But the meaſures ſail'd
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:53621:271"/>him he had taken, and the term expir'd, without his being in a Condition to perform the Clauſe of the Contract; ſo that ſeeing the firſt Proprietor take Poſſeſſion of the Houſe again, he laid it ſo to Heart, that he tumbl'd himſelf head-long into the Well.</p>

               <hi>Antiochus Tibertus</hi> was brought from <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſene,</hi> the place of his Birth, into <hi>France,</hi> by a Souldier, that made him ſtudy at <hi>Paris.</hi> He follow'd his Genius, which inclin'd him to the ſtudy of Natural Magick tho' this Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was them ſo dangerous, that ſince two hundred years that <hi>Piero Daponno</hi> dy'd, no Man had dar'd to be tampering that way. He imagin'd that it had only been Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, by not having been hitherto plainly and ingenuouſly laid down and diſcover'd, but that it wou'd be infallibly Courted by all Mankind, when it ſhou'd be ſeen deckt with the Ornaments of other Sciences. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Principle, he became a ſhrewd and learned Profeſſor in Polite Learning, in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſohy, Phyſick, and the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, and returning into his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where there needed no more for his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in ſecurity, than to ſeduce ſome petty Prince; this was the more eaſie for him to effect, ſince during his abode in <hi>France,</hi> he paſs'd for a famous Wizzard among the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers of that Kingdom. He gave a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:53621:272"/>for moſt of his Predictions, which other Sooth-ſayers, nor the very Oracles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, had not yet bethought themſelves of doing, and on this ſcore was he conſulted by Perſons of all Qualities and Conditions, from the Prince to the Cobler; and at all times was there ſo great a Concourſe of People at his Gate, that very often a body muſt have waited there ſeveral hours, to get to ſpeak to him in one's turn. He wrote very Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Books of Chiromancy, or Palmiſtry, Phiſiognomy, and Pyromancy; and viewing one day <hi>Guido de Bogni</hi>'s Hand, ſurnamed <hi>Guerra,</hi> or <hi>War,</hi> on the account of his Valour, he aſſur'd him, that the beſt of his Friends wou'd cauſe him to be Aſſaſſinated, upon an ill grounded ſuppoſition, to which there was ſo much the leſs likelihood, that <hi>Bogni</hi> being the moſt determinate Souldier of his time, and Courting, hand over head, the moſt dangerous occaſions, was, in all probability, like to periſh fighting, one time or other. He likewiſe foretold, by the ſame way, <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolfo Malateſta,</hi> Soveraign of <hi>Remini,</hi> the Richeſt Prince of <hi>Italy,</hi> in ready Caſh, that he wou'd dye of Miſery, in the Hoſpital of <hi>Bologna.</hi> In a word, the fancy took him to Calculate his own Nativity, and he found it his Fate to be Beheaded; and thus all came to paſs. <hi>Malateſta</hi> was under a ſtrict en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:53621:272"/>with <hi>Bogni,</hi> and truſted him with the Command of his Troops. <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> his Father-in Law, ſent him word, that he had committed the Sheep to the keeping of the Wolf; and that <hi>Bogni</hi> had treated with the Pope, for the remitting <hi>Remini</hi> under the Obedience of the Holy See. There needed no more to diſpoſe <hi>Malateſta</hi> to invite <hi>Bogni</hi> to a Feaſt, at which <hi>Tibertus</hi> had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to attend. <hi>Bogni</hi> was ſtabb'd, while at Dinner, and <hi>Tibertus</hi> popt into a Dungeon, in the Cittadel, his Hands garniſh'd with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron Ruffs, and his Feet with Fetters, till ſuch time as they ſhou'd put him upon the Rack, for the making him reveal the Accomplices of the pretended Conſpiracy. In the mean while <hi>Bogni</hi>'s Innocence came to light, and <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> thinking him ſtill alive, wrote to his Son in-Law, that he had giv'n him a falſe Intelligence. <hi>Malateſta</hi> repented his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſo haſty, and was going to <hi>Tiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> his Dungeon, to free him thence, when he met with an account, that this Wizzard had been caught making his eſcape. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Tibertus</hi> calling to mind his Horoſcope, and not knowing his Caſe to be in good terms, he had ſo well cajol'd the Goaler's Daughter, that ſhe had let him down with a Rope into the Ditch, where the jingling of his Fetters diſcover'd him to the Sentinel:
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:53621:273"/>
               <hi>Malateſta</hi> coming in juſt in that nick, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd him to be Criminal, ſeeing he had that way attempted to get out of Priſon; and without other form of Proceſs, had him Beheaded. In a ſhort time after, the Duke <hi>de Valentinois</hi> ſurpriz'd <hi>Rimini,</hi> and <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſta,</hi> by meer hazard, making his eſcape, wandred from Town to Town, till being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by his own very Children, upon his having endeavour'd to ſet them at odds; He found no other retreat, than the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of <hi>Bologna,</hi> wherein he dy'd.</p>

<pb n="462" facs="tcp:53621:274"/>he wrote Verſes, worthy of Antiquity, for the Dutcheſs <hi>Lacretia Borgia.</hi> He was Gallant, and very Ingenuous in Repartees; as he made a Lady ſenſible, upon her twit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him with his being Lame; for he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaneouſly reply'd, that <hi>Venus,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood her ſelf as well as ſhe, at leaſt in Love, had nevertheleſs preferr'd <hi>Vulcan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others.

But they were miſtaken, for hardly was the buſineſs known, but that <hi>Sforza</hi> coming to ſup at the Palace, was kill'd without any inqueſt being ſince made into th' Aſſaſſination.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Barthelemi Cocles</hi> ſtudy'd only Chiroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Metopoſcopy, but he became ſo knowing that no body ever made ſo many true Predictions. He was more hardy than other Wizzards; for he caus'd a Book to be Printed, enrich'd with Figures, wherein he reveal'd all the ſecret of his Art, explain'd all the Lines of the Hand, all the different
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:53621:274"/>Features of the Face, and laid open the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of each thing in particular. The Learned <hi>Achillini</hi> made a Preface to it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually admir'd by the Friends and Enemies of the Art of Fortune-telling, and <hi>Cocles</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd his Poſitions, by an Experience, which brought him into a general Vogue. <hi>Luca Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> ſo famous in Judicial Aſtrology, cou'd not make his own Horoſcope, for want of knowing the day, and hour, and place of his Birth. He had recourſe to <hi>Cocles,</hi> who, view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Hand, foretold him, that he wou'd ſuddenly undergo a Puniſhment, without having deſerv'd it, but yet dye of it he wou'd not. And indeed <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> Lord of <hi>Bologna,</hi> being inform'd that <hi>Gaurie</hi> had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told that he ſhou'd be driven out of his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, before the years end, caus'd him to be Kidnapt, and commanded he ſhou'd have the Strapado giv'n him five times together, which was accordingly executed; but alſo was he diveſted, in the time that <hi>Gaurie</hi> had noted. As to <hi>Cocles,</hi> he had no leſs fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen the day and hour of his own Death. He knew it his Fate to be kill'd by a blow on his Head, and had Arm'd himſelf with an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron Coif, under his Hat, and with a two-handed Sword, with which he Fenced Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently well. Yet <hi>Hermes Bentivoglio,</hi> the Great Lord of <hi>Bologna</hi>'s Son, had deſir'd him
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:53621:275"/>ſo earneſtly to tell him his Fortune, that he had declar'd to him he ſhou'd be baniſh'd, and kill'd in a Battel, which happen'd afterwards. But then <hi>Hermes,</hi> the moſt Brutal Man of his time, wou'd needs be reveng'd on <hi>Cocles,</hi> in cauſing him to be aſſaſſinated by <hi>Caponi,</hi> the moſt reſolute of his Father's Guards. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pani</hi> excus'd doing it a long while, and wou'd never have reſolv'd upon it, had not the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy took him one day to conſult <hi>Cocles,</hi> who, not knowing him, told him; <hi>Alas my Friend, you'l commit a deteſtable Murther before it's yet night. Caponi</hi> being ſurpriz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d at ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected a Prediction, imagin'd <hi>Cocles</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd on his Credulity, as he had done on that of <hi>Hermes,</hi> and thereupon took his meaſures to kill him. He went and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd himſelf in the accoutrements of a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for the better performing his Deſign, and return'd in the moment that <hi>Cocles,</hi> who had been conſtrain'd for an indiſpenſable Affair to go abroad, came back, and was juſt putting the Key into the Lock of his Door, he gave him ſo great a blow, with an Ax, that the Iron Coif cou'd not hinder <hi>Cocles</hi> head from being cloven. In his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet a Book was found, written with his own hand, containing Predictions for thoſe of his Acquaintance, whoſe Hands and Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:53621:275"/>he had obſerv'd, and the Event juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd 'em to be all infallible, there not being a Perſon of that number, but dy'd after him of the Death he had noted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Johannes Cotta</hi> was <hi>Catullus</hi> his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and had almoſt the ſame Genius. He gave himſelf to <hi>Barthelemi de Lalviano,</hi> and offer'd to keep him Company, when the <hi>French</hi> had taken him at the Battel of <hi>Laghi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ara Dadda,</hi> and this Office being declin'd, he went to <hi>Rome</hi> to haſten his Benefactor's Ranſome, and dy'd there of the Plague, at eight and twenty years old. His Epigrams have the turn of thoſe of <hi>Martial,</hi> and his Orations ſhew he had already read good Books. He had likewiſe Compos'd a Choro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy in Verſe, and Obſervations upon <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> but it's not known what are become of thoſe two Works.</p>
